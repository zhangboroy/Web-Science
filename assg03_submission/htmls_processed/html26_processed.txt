Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam title for five years on Sunday morning - and nobody was more pleased for him than Arsenal's Mesut Ozil.
Federer secured his status as one of sport's greatest athletes with a five-set win over Rafael Nadal that sealed his 18th Grand Slam title.
The Swiss leaptÂ into the air as his shot was -Â on review -Â adjudged by hawk-eye to a have caught the line, sealing Federer's fifth Australian Open title.

The climax to the final was watched by Arsenal players in their London Colney training ground gym where Swiss midfielder,Â Granit Xhaka, recorded Federer's winning moment on his phone.Â 
Arsenal were taking part in a recovery session following their 5-0 FA Cup win over Southampton on Saturday afternoon, but Mesut Ozil showed no signs of fatigue as he wildly celebrated Federer's victory.Â

In scenes that appeared out of character for the laid back German, Mesut Ozil is filmed leapingÂ around the room cheering as Federer seals his 18th Grand Slam title..
The 28-year-oldÂ isÂ joined in his jubilant celebrations by his fellow Germany international, Shkodran Mustafi.
Arsenal's Spanish contingent looked far less enthused with Federer's five-set victory, with Lucas Perez and Monreal both looking on glumlyÂ as Ozil pumpsÂ his fists in front of his teammates.Â

Mesut Ozil was not the only sporting titan to congratulate Federer on his historic feat, with Sachin Tendulkar and Usain Bolt among the raft of sportsmen to pay homage to the Swiss.

Federer was once a guest of honour at the Emirates in March 2015 ahead of Arsenal'sÂ Champions League match with Anderlecht.
"It's always a pleasure to come here, it's a beautiful stadium with a great team," said Federer.
Federer, who was a talented footballer as a child, admitted he made the right decision opting for a carrer on the tennis court.
"I took the right decision to play tennis. Even though I do love football. I would've loved to have been successful soccer, too, but I'm happy I chose tennis in the end."
