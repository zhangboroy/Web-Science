Ray Wilkins can't see Arsenal beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge

                Chelsea face Arsenal on Saturday, live on Sky Sports 1            

 The Premier League Daily panel think Chelsea's showdown with Arsenal on Saturday (Sky Sports 1, 11.30am) will prove pivotal in the title race.
But while Ray Wilkins expects Chelsea to claim three points and take a giant step towards the title, Tony Cottee thinks it is too early to write the Gunners off.With 22 games played, Chelsea are eight points clear of second-placed Arsenal and the top two will lock horns at Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime.   And former Chelsea man Wilkins does not think Arsenal will be able to throw the title race wide open with a win."I think they are too far behind," said Wilkins. "They are playing the mighty Blues on Saturday at Stamford Bridge and I think Chelsea will beat them."Chelsea don't play European football this season and, having watched them, they can play any way. They can play with the ball and they can play if people put them under pressure.                            Get Sky Sports for £20                                     Upgrade now to watch all eight Sky Sports channels for only £20 for 12 months                   "I think the great game that Chelsea came out of this year was Tottenham at home. Tottenham battered us at Stamford Bridge for 45 minutes and really should have been a couple of goals up."As soon as the second half materialised, it was Chelsea who came back on the front foot, and I thought that was a really important performance.                                Chelsea v Arsenal - Next Saturday 11.30am  "I can't see Arsenal beating Chelsea on Saturday."I said last Christmas, had Arsenal bought [Gonzalo] Higuain in from Napoli - and they might have got him for £50m - I think they might have won the title last year."Tony Cottee thinks six points this week would give Arsenal a real title shot but says they must focus initially on beating Watford at the Emirates on Tuesday.                           Arsenal are eight points behind Chelsea with 16 Premier League games left             "There are 16 games left," said Cottee."If there were six, obviously eight points is too much, but there are still more than enough games there. Chelsea-Arsenal is going to be a key game on Saturday."But just as important for Arsenal is to beat Watford - it's one of those games everybody expects them to win."Watford have to be careful themselves and any game in the Premier League is a tough game. To set up the game at the weekend, Arsenal have to beat Watford first."Grab a NOW TV Sky Sports Day Pass and stay glued in to all the latest transfer news from Sky Sports News HQ as the window draws in, all for just £6.99.
