Chelsea will fail to beat Liverpool on Tuesday, predicts Arsenal legend Paul Merson.
Antonio Conte’s side travel to Anfield for a hugely anticipated Premier League meeting. Many feel that should Chelsea beat Jurgen Klopp’s side they will have taken a huge step to winning the title.

However, Merson does not expect that to happen, despite the current form of the two teams pointing towards a win for the London club.
‘I’m going to throw a bombshell out there – I cannot see Chelsea winning at Anfield,’ Merson told Sky Sports. ‘Forget about Liverpool’s recent struggles, this is going to be Chelsea’s toughest game of the season so far. Tuesday night, under the floodlights and a game Liverpool cannot afford to lose – things will be different.’
Liverpool have won just once in eight games and lost their last three matches at Anfield, while in contrast Chelsea have won 18 of their last 19 games.

If the match was to go with form, and then Chelsea defeat Arsenal who they play on Saturday, the title will almost certainly go to Stamford Bridge, thinks Merson.
‘If Chelsea win, and then beat Arsenal, then the title race is virtually done and dusted. But I see plenty more twists and turns in the title race yet, starting with a draw here. That being said, Chelsea will be more than happy leaving Merseyside with a point.’
