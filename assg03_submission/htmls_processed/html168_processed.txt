Liverpool have joined the growing list of clubs showing interest in young Nigerian forward Henry Onyekuru, according to reports.
The 19-year-old is enjoying a fantastic run for Belgian top-flight side AS Eupen, netting 10 goals in 22 games this season.

Onyekuru recently claimed Brendan Rodgers’ Celtic had made an official approach for his services, while a host of European clubs are believed to be monitoring his progress.
And, according to The Sun, Liverpool are the latest to show interest in the forward, who signed his first professional deal in 2015.
Last year the highly-rated teenager revealed he had plans to move to the Premier League in the near future, but named Arsenal as the club he dreamed of joining.

On following in the footsteps of compatriot Wilfred Ndidi, the Eupen star said: ‘I’d like to go to England. Ndidi is my example, we are from the same region in Nigeria.
‘I would rather go to Arsenal. I know there are many scouts who follow me but I remain calm.’
Onyekuru also stated that Gunners legend Thierry Henry was his idol while growing up.
