Liverpool Fans Unimpressed as Gotze Transfer Rumours ResurfaceArsenal to Move Swiftly & Sign Atletico Madrid Superstar Ahead of Premier League RivalAlex Gidden29 Jan 2017​Arsenal are prepared to rival Manchester United for the signing of Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, according to reports in the ​Mail. The Frenchman has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford and reports earlier this month suggested that the player had already verbally agreed personal terms with the Red Devils, including both his weekly wages and potential shirt number. Manchester United's pursuit of Antoine Griezmann has been rocked by a surprise move from Arsenal.#TransferTalk: https://t.co/ctaq0HWUPN pic.twitter.com/NczmIRr2AL— ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) January 29, 2017


However, whilst speculation continues to indicate that Griezmann's move to Manchester in the summer is becoming more and more likely, the Mail suggest that Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is also keen on the French international and is willing to match the £85m offer that United are prepared to make to Atletico. The Gunners reportedly failed in an attempt to sign the forward at the end of the European Championships last summer, partly because he had just agreed a new long-term deal with his current club, which ties him down until June 2021. 

But the north Londoners are now expected to renew their interest in Griezmann this summer and though they are unlikely to match United's weekly wage offer due to their rigid system, the Mail report that they would be willing to pay him as much as £250k-a-week. Both Premier League club's will now be hoping that Atletico are able to overturn their transfer embargo which currently bans them from signing any new players in the summer. Should they fail to win their appeal against the embargo, then they would be less willing to listen to offers for their main striker, regardless of how much both Arsenal and United are prepared to pay for him. Antoine Griezmann has been promised the number seven shirt if he joins #mufc.
