Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is reportedly ready to revive his interest in signing Arsenal right-back Hector Bellerin in the summer transfer window.

The Spain international is regarded as one of the best full-backs in Europe at the moment after his fine form for the Gunners in recent years, though he only recently signed a new contract at the Emirates Stadium.
City boss Guardiola is a known fan of his fellow countryman, and is said to be eyeing him as one of five main targets for next season as he plots a major overhaul of his City squad.

According to The Times, the 46-year-old is also keen on Bayern Munich’s Juan Bernat, Valencia’s Jose Gaya and Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk as additions in defence, while Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is a priority up front.

It seems unlikely that Arsenal would let Bellerin go at this stage, with the 21-year-old also known to be very loyal to current Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.
After signing a six-and-a-half-year deal in November, Bellerin said: ‘I’ve been here for a long time and I feel like this is my home so this was the right thing to do. I’m really happy to be a Gunner for a few more years.

‘This is my home. The club who gave me my first opportunity.’
City, however, have a habit of raiding Arsenal for their best players in recent times, landing the likes of Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna, Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor from the north Londoners in the last decade.
