Mesut Ozil was particularly delighted to see the 35-year-old tennis star beat Rafael Nadal as the Gunners players celebrated the result from the gym







Arsenal players love to celebrate victories, even when they are not their own. The Gunners players have split opinion in recent years with their tendency to post selfies on social media from the dressing room in the wake of a win.
Barcelona denied blatant goal by referee
After beating Premier League rivals Southampton 5-0 in the FA Cup on Saturday, the players gathered together in the gym on Sunday and were soon sent into jubilant celebrations once again.
However, it was not a football related, or even Arsenal related, event that caused the chaos, instead it was Roger Federer's Australian Open final win over Rafael Nadal that did it, as the players watched on together.
The football world itself was left in awe of the 35-year-old Swiss tennis star's exploits against the Spaniard, but no one seemed as inspired by it as Mesut Ozil was, going by Granit Xhaka's Instagram video.





 

A video posted by Granit Xhaka (@granitxhaka) on Jan 29, 2017 at 4:47am PST



The Germany international, and a few other Arsenal stars, seemed to take more joy from it than one of the Gunners' own wins!
Xhaka was delighted to see his compatriot win the tournament, adding a message to the video which read: "What a game!!! The KING is back, the one and only [Roger Federer]."
The same could not be said about Lucas Perez, Nacho Monreal and Hector Bellerin, though, who were all dejected amongst the glee after seeing their countryman Nadal lose.
