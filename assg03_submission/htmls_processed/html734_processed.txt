Liverpool Fans Unimpressed as Gotze Transfer Rumours ResurfaceManchester United and Arsenal Enter the Fray to Sign Wantaway Hammer Dimitri PayetAlex Elleman18 Jan 2017Since his refusal to line up for West Ham following his pleas to leave London Stadium, Dimitri Payet has been targeted by multiple suitors, including Ligue 1 side Marseille and a possible move to the Chinese Super League. However, current reports are saying that Manchester United and Arsenal are opening talks with the 29-year-old.

As reported in the Daily Star, via TeamTalk.com, both Arsenal and Manchester United have been monitoring the situation and have now made tentative enquiries to sign the French midfielder.Despite Payet's desire to leave West Ham, the London side is still refusing to let him leave quickly after already rejecting two bids for a potential Marseille return at £19.1m and £20m. Co-chairman, Sullivan and David Gold refuse to be bullied into a quick sale stating they have no financial need to sell the 29-year-old. Payet, who was once a fan favourite, has received no love from Hammers supporters since announcing that he will be refusing to play for the side last week.In what has already been a frustrating season for both Dimitri Payet and Slaven Bilic's men, the news of him wanting a January exit could put West Ham in an unwanted relegation battle.The 29-year-old has been a talisman at the club since joining in the summer of last season from Lille, scoring 11 goals from 48 appearances for the Hammers across two seasons and voted West Ham Player of the Season in the 2015/16 campaign.However, the news of his exit has left the club and fans furious with the midfielder, especially considering he committed his future to the club by signing a five-year contract in February of last year, in which he received a £1m loyalty bonus last September.With the Hammer's refusing to let go of their star-man, clubs that want to acquire the French midfielder may have to spend more to convince West Ham to let Payet leave.As Arsenal and Manchester United have both in recent seasons delved into funds to acquire star players, the reports of them possibly bidding for Payet may lead to the 29-year-old relocating in England.
