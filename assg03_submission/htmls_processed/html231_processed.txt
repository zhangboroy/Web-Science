29Jan Fresh injury scare for Arsenal as midfielder picks up calf problemWritten by Bill McLoughlin








 No Comments   
Arsenal midfielder, Mohamed Elneny picked up a calf injury while away with Egypt’s during the African Cup of Nations campaign, which ruled him out of their quarter-final match against Morocco on Sunday evening, as reported by the Mirror.  
Elneny’s injury was confirmed by Egypt officials but it is still unclear as to how severe the injury actually is. Egypt are scheduled to play Burkina Faso in the first semi-final on February 1 which if they win will see them play in the final four days later. If the Egyptian team does progress, Elneny could well likely stay with the squad in the hope of playing instead of returning to England.
Either through injury or through Egypt’s success, Elneny will miss Arsenal’s crucial game against Chelsea on February 4.
