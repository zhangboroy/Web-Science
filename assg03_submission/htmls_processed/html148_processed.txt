Manchester United have appointed Legia Warsaw’s director of scouting Radoslaw Kucharski as their new talent spotter for players in Eastern Europe.
Kucharski has spent nearly 10 years with the Polish champions but will now begin his stint at Old Trafford on February 1.
Kucharski began his career by scouting players for Legia’s academy before progressing to recruiting for the first team, and is credited with discovering Krystian Bielik, who joined Arsenal in a £2.7 million deal two years ago.
‘It is a great honor that Manchester United are interested in me,’ Kucharski told Legia’s official website.

‘I treat it primarily as an appreciation of our shared interest and my personal work for Legia, of which I am particularly proud of.
‘Talks with Manchester United about a possible move took place since June and I will join on February 1.’
