Oxlade-Chamberlain truly excellent in one of his best Arsenal performances



Danny Welbeck recorded his first multi-goal game since Oct. 2014, but does this warrant a place in Arsenal's starting XI? 

Arsenal cruised past Southampton with a comfortable win to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup. 

Arsene Wenger says his absence from the bench was a bit odd, but heaped praise on his young midfield. 
At a ground where they haven't won since 2003, Arsenal showed they have some serious strength in depth as they hammered Southampton 5-0. Both managers made significant changes to their starting XIs, but Arsene Wenger's side had so much quality that it did not make any real difference.
Danny Welbeck scored twice on his first start since April 2016, while Theo Walcott grabbed a hat trick against his former club to ensure a safe and enjoyable passage into the fifth round of the FA Cup.
The home side gave Arsenal little trouble, and the performances of some of the so-called fringe players picked by Wenger were extremely promising.

Lineups and Stats


Positives
Where to start? Welbeck scoring twice on his comeback, Walcott scoring a hat trick, substitute Alexis Sanchez grabbing two assists, Lucas Perez stepping up again and a comprehensive win on a ground that has proved troublesome in the past.
Perhaps the most promising aspect of the game was the performances of the double-barrelled trio in midfield. Youngsters Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Jeff Reine-Adelaide were both mature beyond their years, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had his best performance in a long time in the centre of midfield.
Oxlade-Chamberlain was creative, aggressive and defensively sound. This was as good as he's ever performed for Arsenal. Considering some of the trepidation voiced when the teams were announced, they all showed they have what it takes.
Negatives
There weren't any. Trying to find negatives would be nothing but nitpicking.
Manager rating out of 10
10 -- When you go away from home, pick a team that concerns many before kickoff, cope with big players being missing or suspended and win 5-0, you can't give anything but a 10.
Player ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating)
GK David Ospina, 7 -- Had little to do in truth, but was decisive and dominant with his handling when called upon.
DF Hector Bellerin, 7 -- Still looks as if he's finding his way from injury a bit and was a touch careless at times with the ball.
DF Shkodran Mustafi, 8 -- Provided important experience for the backline, won a lot of headers and used the ball well.
DF Rob Holding, 8 -- Dealt with the perpetually irritant Shane Long extremely well and deserves a lot of credit for it.
DF Kieran Gibbs, 7 -- Put in a solid performance and got forward well at times while also being switched on defensively.
MF Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 8 -- Belied his years and inexperience with an outstanding centre-midfield performance. The 19-year-old was good on the ball and his defensive work was absolutely brilliant.
MF Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 9 -- It's unlikely to be any coincidence that his best performances for Arsenal come in the centre. Was truly excellent against his former club, playing creatively and showing superb passing range. Very impressive.


Is it a coincidence that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's best performances come in the centre of the pitch? We think not...
MF Jeff Reine-Adelaide, 8 -- Is another great young prospect who really displayed some tremendous maturity at times. His ability to skip away with the ball from tight situations is fantastic.
MF Danny Welbeck, 9 -- It's brilliant to see him back on the scoresheet after such a long time out injured. It can take a player some time to get back to full speed, but the finishes for both goals showed a man who is determined to make up for lost time.
MF Theo Walcott, 9 -- His hat trick makes him the second Arsenal player ever to score one in the league, the FA Cup and the League Cup, the other being Ian Wright. Considering he hadn't played since Dec. 21, he was very sharp.
FW Lucas Perez, 8 -- Set up the first with the kind of flick that would have made Dennis Bergkamp proud. Was denied a goal late on, but every time he plays he looks capable of making a significant contribution.
Substitutes
FW Alexis Sanchez, 8 -- Putting him on at 3-0 in a cup tie that looked won might have appeared strange, but he set up two goals for Walcott to make the scoreline even more decisive.
MF Alex Iwobi, 7 -- Came on and slotted seamlessly into the midfield.
