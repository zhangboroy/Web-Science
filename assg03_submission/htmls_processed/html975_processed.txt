Ex Arsenal Youngster Chuks Aneke Scores Contender For GOTY
Posted By: soccerasson: January 29, 2017In: Eagles WatchNo Comments Print Email
Former Arsenal youth player Chuks Aneke, scored an absolute thunderbolt of a goal as MK Dons recorded a high scoring victory over Peterborough at London Road on Saturday
MK Dons demolished Peterborough  4-0 in a brilliant second half display courtesy of goals from Harvey Barnes, Kieran Agard and a spectacular double from Anglo Nigerian Chuks Aneke 
The Former Arsenal midfielder  returned to England after a brief stint in Belgium and joined MK Dons in August on a one-year contract despite him recovering from a knee surgery that prevented him making his debut for the club for four months
He joined from Belgian top-flight side Zulte Waregem where he scored four goals in 41 appearances
The 23 year old Aneke has found a rich run of form scoring his second brace for Dons after scoring his first goals for the club in the 5-3 win over Northampton last weekend making it back to back braces
Speaking to reporters after the game a delighted Chuks said he let out his frustration at his long injury in that goal
“I watched a lot of the games when I was injured, and we’re a good team,” 
“We out-played a lot of teams but I felt the team was missing something. But that missing thing is in the team now, and we’re confident. On our day, we can beat anyone. “I can pick a pass, and I know if there is pace in front of me, I can get them in. 
Nicky and Kieran make good runs, and they’re both good finishers. So if you put me in behind them, there will be chances, I’ve always said that. It’s just about us keeping clean sheets. 
“There was a lot of frustration in that shot!” Aneke said. “The gaffer has been really good to me and we’re all playing really well. If we keep on putting in performances like this, we’ll keep climbing the league.” He added
The former Arsenal youth player who was once compared with Yaya Toure by Arsene Wenger, has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, and under-19 levels but remains eligible to play for Nigeria through his parents.
He was approached by then coach Samson Siasia to commit to the Super Eagles back in 2011
