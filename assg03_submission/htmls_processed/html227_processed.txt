Atletico Madrid Target Arsenal Star as Possible Antoine Griezmann Replacement

​Spanish giants Atletico Madrid are lining up a bid for Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez should striker Antoine Griezmann leave the club.
Griezmann has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United while Sanchez is yet to sign a new deal with Arsenal, fuelling speculation of a possible transfer away from the Premier League.



​The Sun claim Atletico are resigned to losing Griezmann, who has emerged as one of Europe’s best players in recent seasons, and are hopeful of landing Sanchez, with Diego Simeone’s side reportedly ready to offer the Chilean up to £220,000-a-week in wages.
Sanchez’s current contract saga at Arsenal has been well documented but the substantial increase offered by Atletico may be too good for the former Barcelona forward to turn down. Sanchez currently earns £160,000-a-week at the Emirates but is yet to commit his future to Arsene Wenger’s side through a new contract.



Atletico expect to sell Griezmann to Manchester United for £86m – his release clause figure – and that healthy sum will enable the La Liga side to bid around £35m for Sanchez, who they see as a natural successor to Griezmann, as well as affording his wage demands.
Sanchez signed for Arsenal in 2014 for a fee of £33m and only has 18 months left on his contract. Mesut Ozil is also yet to commit his future to Arsenal, while manager Arsene Wenger is also undecided on whether to sign a new deal. Sanchez is apparently unconcerned by Wenger’s contract situation.
Sanchez has scored 15 goals and contributed seven assists in 22 Premier League games, with Arsenal currently second in the league.
