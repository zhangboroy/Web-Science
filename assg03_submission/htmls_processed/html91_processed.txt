PAT’S DONE
Patrick van Aanholt has completed a £14million move to Crystal Palace.
Dutch left-back Van Aanholt, 26, has signed a four-and-a-half year deal with the Eagles and could be thrown into the side for Tuesday’s clash with Tottenham.
The Black Cats begrudgingly accepted the Eagles’ offer, which is £12million up front with £2million in add-ons.

TOFFEES REUNION
Sunderland are on the verge of completing a double deal for Everton’s Darron Gibson and Bryan Oviedo, according to reports.
Both men have been demoted to the fringes at Goodison Park since the arrival of Ronald Koeman as manager.
And Black Cats boss David Moyes, desperate to add to his depleted squad, has agreed a cut-price fee with his former employers for the duo.

BURN BRADY BURN
Burnley hope to push through a £13million deal to bring in Robbie Brady from Norwich City after the Canaries signed Ajax left-back Mitchell Dijks on loan.
Sunderland are also interested in the Republic of Ireland star, but look likely to pull out of the running for the 25-year-old due to injuries in their attack.
He is expected to complete his move to Lancashire before Tuesday night’s transfer deadline slams shut.

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
Crystal Palace are keen on former Juventus defender Martin Caceres.
It seems that Caceres, who also played for Barcelona, is set to link up with Palace for training so that boss Sam Allardyce can assess his fitness levels.
Caceres, 29, is still a free agent after leaving Juventus last summer when his contract expired.
DOUBLE TROUBLE
Arsene Wenger has warned Carl Jenkinson he must “find happiness” if he is to leave Arsenal – and that Mathieu Debuchy could exit this transfer window.
The Gunners boss confirmed any move for right-back Jenkinson would be permanent, but that no offers have been forthcoming so far.
Deals stop when the window shuts tomorrow night at 11pm.
