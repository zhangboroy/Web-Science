Talks between Arsenal and the 28-year-old have been in stalemate for a while — and Atletico have made their interest known to the striker’s representatives.
The Spaniards are resigned to losing Antoine Griezmann to Manchester United this summer and see Sanchez as a natural goalscoring replacement for the French superstar.

Griezmann, 25, is expected to fetch his £86million release clause, which will enable Atletico to bid about £35m for the Arsenal ace as well as afford his salary demands.
Sanchez — who signed from Barcelona for £33m in 2014 — has just 18 months of his contract remaining.

Even his close friends have admitted that they do not know if he wants to stay in London, but Atletico believe they can tempt him to make a return to La Liga.
Arsene Wenger remains undecided about his own future, though it is understood Sanchez is not concerned by the Gunners manager’s situation.
Sanchez has scored 15 Premier League goals this season and Arsenal fans have been begging him to stay at the Emirates.
