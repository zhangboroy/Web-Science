Roma have agreed a deal worth £20 million plus add-ons in the form of two youth players heading to Atalanta, according to Calciomercato.
Kessie will link up with Roma once the season is over with the Serie A club now all but certain to have secured the 20-year-old’s signature.
The news will be a blow to Antonio Conte who had earmarked the youngster as the perfect man to partner N’Golo Kante in the Chelsea midfield.
