					Or, as I just saw Anzac suggested - "Wengersims"  .

To those of you who missed my horribly long and boring previous suggestion, it's all about the boss' gems. He seems to have an exceptional talent - we all agree on that, love or hate him - to utter stuff that sends you to the roof or the floor. Either really funny, peculiar, original, "telling", or what have you.
Only one request from all of you: this is supposed to be amusing - let's keep it at that. There are enough threads and proper places for the "substantial" stuff, Wenger out or, indeed, in. And let's try to keep the really banal stuff out - not everything he says is worth repeating. I don't want this to be too long, so first example will follow in the next post.
(Biggus - I was never going to deny you that, mate  )

					I felt we had to have this thread when he said "Robin Van Persie is not injury prone". It is somewhere on mother-ship .com, if you don't believe it (also on my related post in "wenger-out". By the way, I hope having this thread will not take anything from the amusing potential that the other thread has - I just love it!)
The next, as some of you noticed this morning, and I agreed with Anzac totally, he actually issued a roaming license to song, and he doesn't expect it to hurt our defensive stability. The stuff he says there is really full of these "gems" (I leave it to you guys to find others among them. To me a stand out is that he looks like he is totally confusing the attacking input he's looking for with a defensive input, in applying a higher pressure (which, incidentally, is not easily traced in his relevant remarks). Anyway, the "pearl", as I should do what I preach, is in "I gave Song a license to roam". http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-why-song-has-a-licence-to-roam
We'd sometimes actually hope there's more bureaucracy when licenses are issued.

"Days not weeks." - when asked how long rosicky will be out. ( he was out for almost 18 months.

"One of the things I discovered in Japan was from watching sumo wrestling. At the end you can never tell who has won the fight, and who has lost, because they do not show their emotion because it could embarrass the loser. It is unbelievable. That is why I try to teach my team politeness. It is only here in England that everybody pokes their tongue out when they win."

Awesome one, that last one.

					"Politically, I am for efficiency. Economically first. Until the 1980s the world was divided into two, people were either communist or capitalist. The communist model does not work economically, we all realised that, but the capitalist model in the modern world also looks to be unsustainable. You cannot ignore individual interests, but I believe the world evolves slowly. The last 30 years have brought a minimum amount of money for everybody in the west, the next step, politically, would be a maximum amount of money earned by everybody." 


=============================


"If I asked you who was the best team in the world you would say Brazil. And do they play good football? Yes. Which club won everything last year? Barcelona. Good football. I am not against being pragmatic, because it is pragmatic to make a good pass, not a bad one. If I have the ball, what do I do with it? Could anybody argue that a bad solution like just kicking it away is pragmatic just because, sometimes, it works by accident?"

					One of the favourites has to be when he said something like:

"Bischoff can become the signing of the season. I took a gamble on him, but when he gets fit you should see his true potential"
