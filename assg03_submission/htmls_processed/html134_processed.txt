Arsenal defender Carl Jenkinson unlikely to leave in window - Wenger



Carl Jenkinson failed to agree personal terms for a Crystal Palace switch.
LONDON -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said right-back Carl Jenkinson is unlikely to complete a move before Tuesday's deadline and dismissed speculation that he is interested in Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema.
Arsenal had agreed a deal with Crystal Palace for Jenkinson but the defender failed to agree personal terms, and Wenger told a news conference: "There's no news about him at all.
"We have many players in his position, but at the moment it doesn't look like something will happen."
The Gunners have also made Jenkinson's fellow right-back Mathieu Debuchy available, but Wenger said that although the club have not yet received an offer for the Frenchman it was "still possible" he would be sold.
Wenger said in December that he would drop Jenkinson because of a lack of confidence after the player was heavily criticised after returning from a long-term knee injury.
But the Arsenal boss said: "Carl Jenkinson is a great player who has a great attitude. There is no problem on that front."
Arsenal's only January signing has been young prospect Cohen Bramall, a left-back bought from non-league Hednesford Town from around £40,000.
Wenger said he did not expect any other signings despite renewed speculation over Benzema.
Asked why the Real Madrid man is regularly linked with Arsenal, Wenger said: "Because he's French. And maybe there are some noises that he would leave Madrid, but there is no need for us to buy any strikers."
