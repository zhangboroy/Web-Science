Walter Mazzarri did not want to move the game with Arsenal


The Italian takes his side to The Emirates on deadline day before hosting relegation rivals Burnley on Saturday.Watford are playing Millwall in the FA Cup this afternoon and have barely 48 hours to prepare for the trip to north London.It appears Mazzarri has decided to prioritise the Burnley game after selecting a weakened team for today's fourth round clash with an eye on Arsenal and then getting maximum rest ahead of the clash with the Clarets.

            “By doing this, we have one more day to recover ahead of Burnley”
        
Walter Mazzarri

He told the Hertfordshire Mercury: "After my long experience, many years playing in the Champions League and the Europa League, I am used to playing three games in one week."I have evaluated this a lot and it is a fact that the most fatigue comes in the third game."By doing this, we have one more day to recover ahead of Burnley.



GETTY

Arsene Wenger may have given a green light to the proposal


"Burnley first of all, they play one day before us."Our game was changed because of television rights."If Burnley were going to play the same game, then no problem, but we lost one day to Burnley.
