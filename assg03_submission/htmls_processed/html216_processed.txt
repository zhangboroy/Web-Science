Danny Welbeck celebrates against Southampton 


The Arsenal forward returned with a bang yesterday, scoring the Gunners’ first two goals in the 5-0 win over a weak Southampton side in the FA Cup.
It’s the second time in two years he’s had to battle back from a knee injury which means he had missed the best part of two seasons.
His opener was the first time he had found the net since April and it was a welcome reward for all the hard work.

Welbeck said: “Did the hunger for goals keep me going? Yeah, definitely.
“I think because I had this experience before, coming back from an injury, I kind of knew what to expect even though it’s a tough time.
“It was obviously good to be back out on the pitch after such a long time out, it’s been a tough few months.”

Arsene Wenger was delighted with Danny Welbeck’s return 


Boss Arsene Wenger admitted he was surprised by Welbeck’s impact on his return.
He said: “I knew that he worked hard but you never know how that will transfer into a competitive game.
“It was great to see he hasn’t lost his runs, he hasn’t lost his finishing.

“It shows when you are able to transform that frustration of not playing into efficiency, that’s a special guy.
“You have always two fears, first it takes him too long to get decision making. And secondly, as well, the player is scared to make any contact.
“So when he made the runs and was fighting with the defender, that was a very important moment for me.”
