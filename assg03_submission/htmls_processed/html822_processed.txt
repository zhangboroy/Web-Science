It hasn't all been routine for Arsenal in 2017, but they've won all but one of their five matches since the turn of the year. The Gunners will look to maintain that momentum away at Southampton in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, but with Claude Puel's side also looking in good shape, that could prove more difficult than anticipated.
The Saints endured a tricky festive period, but have won four of their last five in all competitions. They've also enjoyed success in England's other cup competition, having booked their place in the final of the EFL Cup with a 2-0 aggregate win over Liverpool in midweek. Spirits are high at St. Mary's, and they'll be optimistic of eliminating the Gunners.
How to watch, stream, and listen
TV: Fox Sports 1 (U.S.); Sportsnet World (Canada); BT Sport 2 (U.K.)
Online streaming: Fox Sports Go, Fox Soccer 2Go (U.S.); Sportsnet World Now (Canada); BT Sport live streaming (U.K.) 




Make friends: Southampton fans should head on over to St. Mary's Musings for full match coverage; The Short Fuse is over all things Arsenal.

Three big things to know
1. Southampton have several first-teamers sidelined through injury: Virgil van Dijk, Jay Rodriguez, and James Ward-Prowse are chief among them. Jérémy Pied and Matt Targett are also among those on the treatment table. It'll be interesting to see if Puel fields a slightly experimental team after the Saints' midweek efforts at Liverpool. 




2. Arsenal will be missing Santi Cazorla, Mathieu Debuchy, and Per Mertesacker through injury, and Granit Xhaka through suspension. Theo Walcott faces a late fitness test, while Mohamed Elneny is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations.
3. Arsenal suffered a shock 4-0 drubbing on their last visit to St. Mary's back in December 2015. Indeed, they've not won away at the Saints in their last five attempts; their last victory on the South Coast came back in 2003, when Robert Pirès scored the only goal of the match.
