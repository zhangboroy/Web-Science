        The most REAL down to earth podcast out there
Hi there, it did not take much effort at all to decide about writing this review, I have been a devoted listener since day 1, this man has done nothing but produce QUALITY content! in fact it has been an honor to follow his podcast and channel and seeing this content grow with quality increase, quite simply there is no other podcast out there that gets down to the brass tax like this one.

Sometimes its petty jokes, other times its puns, either way i feel the suspense as im at the edge of my seat either waiting for a cliff hanger or and epic reaction to some of the latest news in soccer entertainment.

Mario does a great job staying relevant with the scene bringing in some some great names and legends onto the show, if your looking for a quality podcast, look no further this is the real deal and its very easy to see why they refer to the gooner podcast as THE #1 podcast in Canada.

Kind Regards,

        In Depth Football Coverage.
I'm usually pretty critical about where I get my sports news/opinions but this podcast hits all the right spots. Very casual yet still well informed. Looking forward to more episodes.

        Down to earth podcast
Love listening to Mario's antics.  Always bringing relevant content and presenting it in a very entertaining way.  Not your ordinary podcast.  
Keep up the good work.

        Great Show
Love the guest on the show! Always a hoot. Not to analytical, not to serious. A healthy dose of both. Keep up the great work!
