RAY WILKINS SEES ARSENAL BEATING CHELSEA AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!

The Premier League Daily panelist think Chelsea’s showdown with Arsenal on Saturday will prove pivotal in the title race.
 
Ray Wilkins expects Chelsea to claim three points and take a giant step towards the title, Tony Cottee thinks it is too early to write the Gunners off.
 
With 22 games played, Chelsea are eight points clear of second-placed Arsenal and the top two will lock horns at Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime.
 
And former Chelsea man Wilkins does not think Arsenal will be able to throw the title race wide open with a win.
 
“I think they are too far behind,” said Wilkins. “They are playing the mighty Blues on Saturday at Stamford Bridge and I think Chelsea will beat them.
 
“Chelsea don’t play European football this season and, having watched them, they can play any way. They can play with the ball and they can play if people put them under pressure.
 
“I think the great game that Chelsea came out of this year was Tottenham at home. Tottenham battered us at Stamford Bridge for 45 minutes and really should have been a couple of goals up.
 
“As soon as the second half materialised, it was Chelsea who came back on the front foot, and I thought that was a really important performance.
 
“I can’t see Arsenal beating Chelsea on Saturday.
 
“I said last Christmas, had Arsenal bought [Gonzalo] Higuain in from Napoli – and they might have got him for £50m – I think they might have won the title last year.”
