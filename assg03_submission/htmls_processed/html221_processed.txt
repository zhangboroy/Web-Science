Arsenal players watched during a gym session as Roger Federer won the Australian Open to clinch an 18th Grand Slam title on Sunday.
Mesut Ozil and Shkodran Mustafi went wild as the Swiss star beat Rafael Nadal in five sets to end a five-year wait for major success.
The Arsenal squad were recovering in the club gym after thrashing Southampton 5-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday evening. 
And their morning workout clashed with the Australian Open final as tennis greats Federer and Nadal locked horns again in another epic to crown a remarkable two weeks in Melbourne. 
Spaniards Hector Bellerin, Lucas Perez and Nacho Monreal looked less-than impressed as team-mates Ozil, Mustafi and Alex Oxlade Chamberlian led the Arsenal celebrations. 
Granit Xhaka congratulated his compatriot on the victory with a message on his Instagram page.
