Customer Reviews


The best football podcast out there!
     

by
        
          NOLA_Fredo
        
        
      

    If you are an Arsenal supporter...if you call yourself a gooner...then you have to be listening to the Arsecast! 'Blogger does a great work getting all sorts of opinions (besides his own) in there, ranging from other bloggers and journalists to people involved with the club and even celebrities. Mixed in there though is one of the sharpest wits in the Net, which comes out in the form of characters like the Man In the Bar, Arsene Wenger Hawkins (too few appearances sadly), "George", the P***s of William Gallas and so many others. It's not for kids though, mind that. AND it's definitely not for anyone who cheers for Manchester United, Ashley Cole, Sam Allardyce, Tottenham Hotspur or other ***** of that nature!

    Fantastic podcast, always insightful, knows so much about Arsenal, and his sense of humor is second to none. A must have for Arsenal supporters.
