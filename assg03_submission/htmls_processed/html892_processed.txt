Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 'the artist’ shines in rare central role as Arsenal thrash Southampton in FA Cup

Once might have been a coincidence. Twice could be influenced by luck but what is happening now to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain every time he starts in central midfield has become a pattern.
Gone seems to be the self-doubt that comes with having only the occasional moments in matches to make his mark and instead Oxlade-Chamberlain’s natural strengths – his technique, his physical power, quick feet and vision – are forced upon the game. Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott will naturally attract most headlines for the emphatic nature of this 5-0 win but it was the work of Arsenal’s double barrelled midfield – spearheaded by Oxlade-Chamberlain but supported by Jeff Reine-Adelaide and Ainsley Maitland-Niles – that actually laid the foundation. “I like it in there; you get on the ball a lot,” said Oxlade-Chamberlain. 
It is a position that Arsène Wenger has previously pinpointed as Oxlade-Chamberlain’s best but he has still remained curiously reluctant to back up that observation in his team selections. Indeed, just as against AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Crystal Palace and Stoke City previously over fully five years, Wenger’s hand was partially forced here by other absentees. 
He clearly did not want to take any risk with Francis Coquelin and Aaron Ramsey ahead of two Premier League fixtures now in the space of five days but, even with Granit Xhaka, Mohamed Elneny, Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla variously unavailable to him, Oxlade-Chamberlain’s performance should force a rethink. 
Ramsey has again struggled this season for rhythm in an Arsenal system that simply seems unsuited to his talents and, while he might remain the starting point against Watford and Chelsea, there should be no concern about elevating Oxlade-Chamberlain. Martin Keown described his midfield performance on Saturday as that of “an artist”. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s contract status adds a further urgency to the situation.

There have been no talks about extending a deal that expires next year and, while his performances out wide have rarely convinced, it would be strange to sell him this summer without an extended opportunity in what even Wenger’s regards as his ideal long-term position. Continued participation in the FA Cup should provide further opportunities, as it undoubtedly also will among a group of strikers that are also now flowing with confidence. Alexis Sánchez and Olivier Giroud have carried the goalscoring load for most of the season but Welbeck, Walcott and Lucas Pérez were all excellent as a front three on Saturday against an admittedly feeble Southampton defence. “The problem will now be to find the right combination,” said Wenger, whose touchline ban seemed to have little impact on the team.
With Chelsea looming, this does have the feel of a defining week for Arsenal and Wenger accepts that he probably now does have a squad with more options than Antonio Conte. Arsenal also have the added advantage of Chelsea being at Anfield tomorrow night while they host Watford. It is conceivable, then, that they will have the chance to close the gap to just two points on Saturday.

“I would say we have a larger squad but Chelsea don’t need too much because they don’t play in Europe,” said Wenger. “For a long time we had not the offensive quality available. Danny Welbeck gives us more quality going forward. He went through some moments of very deep disappointment. I wondered if he would be solid enough mentally to cope with that. But he became even more resilient and worked even harder. We had Pérez and Walcott as well and I had Sánchez on the bench. It is an exceptional quality.” 
For Southampton, the one positive was the return in central defence of Florin Gardos at a time when they have just sold Jose Fonte and await anxiously a specialist’s diagnosis on captain Virgil van Dijk’s ankle. “I have been out for about two years since my last official game so I am glad I got through the 90 minutes and hopefully I will build up on this,” said Gardos. 
Manager Claude Puel still wants to to sign a centre-back in the next 48 hours amid fears of a three-month absence for Van Dijk. “I hope on Monday or Tuesday we will have the good answer for him,” he said.
