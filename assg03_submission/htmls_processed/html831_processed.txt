Good evening everyone, welcome to BTM coverage of Southampton v Arsenal in the FA Cup 4th round. @Ugster1 with you for it.

Couple of shocks already today - Liverpool out, Lincoln through. Wycombe so close to another, but plucky little Spurs managed to sneak through by the odd goal in seven.

In terms of team news, this game isn't a shining light for the FA Cup - a total of 20 (twenty) changes made by the teams since their last games. Arsene Wenger will be watching from the stands, of course, as he starts his four match touchline ban.

Arsenal have had the odd problem with Southampton in the last couple of years, but may fancy their chances against a reserve Southampton team, even if Arsenal are fielding a few second-choicers themselves.

Anyway, to the teams...

Southampton first - already booked one trip to Wembley this week, virtually all of those players having a rest though:

As for Arsenal - notable returns for Walcott and Welbeck. And a double barrelled midfield...

The only explanation for the team is Steve Bould has seized all power and gone mad. Especially the full back four named on the bench.



Matt (@Ugster1) 3 weeks ago
Only just spotted that - start of a coup...














 


So with all these changes, anything could happen - could be a good one! Players currently ambling out of the tunnel, so kick off not far away...

Here we go then - last time these two met in a cup was earlier this season at the Emirates when Southampton progressed in the league cup.

Peep peep! We're off. Southampton in red and white stripes, Arsenal in yellow.

(5') - Lively start from Arsenal, couple of half chances as the ball flies across the box. Sounds a decent atmosphere too.

(9') - Good work from Arsenal, breaking well. Ball falls to Oxlade-Chamberlain who has plenty of time to take a shot, but it's along the ground, wide and lacking power. Apart from that, great.

(12') - Arsene sitting next to Boro Primorac in the stands (other seat unoccupied), but Pat Rice appears to be sitting just in front - could always offer a pearl of wisdom or two. On the pitch, Bellerin gets down the right but the cross isn't great and is gathered by Lewis.
