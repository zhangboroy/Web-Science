The Arsenal Supporters Trust (AST) has called on supporters to have their say on the prospect of safe standing at the Emirates Stadium.
AST held an open meeting to discuss the prospect of standing at their home ground on Monday and were joined by representatives of the Football Supporters’ Federation, who are campaigning for trials at selected grounds in the Premier League and Championship, and the English Football League.
Safe standing was introduced by Scottish champions Celtic at the start of this season but all-seater stadia in English league have been required since the Taylor Report that followed the Hillsborough disaster.
In light of the success Celtic have enjoyed at Parkhead AST want Arsenal fans to have their say on the prospect of safe standing at the Emirates.

"On Monday evening the AST held an open meeting on safe standing," a statement on AST's website read. "This meeting was addressed by guest speakers from the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) and (English) Football League.
"Also in attendance to support the discussion were representatives from REDaction, BSM (Black Scarf Movement) and AISA (Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association).
"The meeting heard about the progress that is being made in considering options to return to safe standing and that the Premier League is soon to conduct some formal research and consultation into the subject.

"This work will include discussion with supporters' groups, building on a meeting the AST had with the Premier League chief executive last summer when we urged him to review the issue. This debate follows the successful introduction of safe standing by Celtic Football Club.
"This survey is open to all Arsenal fans and we are hoping for a large response so that we can represent the views of as many people as possible on this important topic."
Supporters have until February 27 to complete the survey.
