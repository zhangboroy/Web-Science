wenger wants a benz
Arsene Wenger suggests Karim Benzema move in the summer is not out of the question with star’s Real Madrid future looking bleak

ARSENAL boss Arsene Wenger has refused to rule out a sensational summer move for Karim Benzema.
The Real Madrid striker has been on the Gunners’ radar in the past, with reports the 29-year-old has been offered to Arsenal, Chelsea and French giants Paris St Germain.

		Karim Benzema waves to Bernabeu crowd after being replaced during Sunday’s win against Real Sociedad	

Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s Premier league game at home to Watford, Wenger made light of the constant link with his fellow countryman. He joked that Benzema is only a reported Gunners target because he’s French.

But the Gunners boss refused to kill off reports the striker could be Emirates-bound in the summer.
Wenger said:“Because he’s French, there are some noises he would leave Madrid.
“In the summer window? That’s not my worry at the moment. What’s my worry is the next game against Watford.”

		Karim Benzema has scored 12 goals this season for Real Madrid	

Despite 12 goals this season for the Spanish giants, Real president Florentino Perez has had enough of Benzema. The Frenchman was also booed by the Bernabeu faithful during the win against Real Sociedad on Sunday.
A move away from the Spanish capital could suit Los Blancos, who are struggling to keep Alvaro Morata happy after the Spaniard rejoined from Juventus this term.

The Gunners boss went on to say he wasn't expecting to do any business before the Tuesday deadline.
Wenger added: “Very quiet. On our front we have a big squad. We are not in the need to buy.
“On the general front it is very quiet. All the teams in England, especially the big teams, have big teams."

Danny Welbeck was outstanding in the 5-0 hammering of Southampton in the FA Cup on Saturday, and Wenger insists his pool of strikers is good enough to challenge on all fronts.
The Gunners boss said: "Of course he has done enough to keep his place but we have to be cautious.
“We can’t use him every three days, I think he is a bit short on that but the quality is there.

		Walcott and Welbeck were both on target for Arsenal against Southampton	

“His return – and the quality of all our strikers – offensively we have a strong squad.”
Meanwhile, Wenger confirmed full back Carl Jenkinson can leave this month but no deal is close. He also revealed there have been no offers for Mathieu Debuchy, who is also free to leave the Emirates.
