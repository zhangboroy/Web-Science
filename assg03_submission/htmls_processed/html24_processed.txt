Sutton chairman, Bruce Elliott, has hailed the “perfect draw” after the National League side were drawn at home to Arsenal in the FA Cup Fifth Round.
Having knocked out Leeds United in the last round, Sutton will once again be huge underdogs, but Elliott insisted it was the ideal tie for his club and its delirious supporters.





FA Cup | Fifth round draw






Arsenal, who are second in the Premier League and last won the competition in 2015, will make the short journey across London to the 5,000 capacity Borough Sports Ground, to face a team of part time footballers, who are 16th in the National League and led by a manager, Paul Doswell, who is not even paid to do the job.
“The whole place went berserk when the draw was made,” said Elliott. “It is unbelievable, nobody can believe it and with some justification. It is just perfect.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better draw. To get a club like Arsenal, a team like Arsenal coming here, it is the ideal game for us.

“I’m so, so happy. The players deserve it, the manager deserves it and the supporters deserve it. I still can’t quite believe what has happened.
“I thought things couldn’t get any better after Sunday. To be playing Arsenal, at home, in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, we are all going to have to pinch ourselves in the morning to check this is really happening.
“It’s the dream draw in many ways and if you could see the faces of our supporters, this is why the FA Cup is such a wonderful competition. This is why the FA Cup still matters. This has been a fantastic story already, one we will never forget, but it has just got even better.”
There were fitting rewards for all of the fourth round giantkillers as National League leaders Lincoln City, who knocked out Championship leaders Brighton on Saturday, travel to Premier League side Burnley. Oxford United, who thrashed Newcastle United, were drawn away to Middlesbrough. Millwall, who knocked out Watford, will take on Premier League champions Leicester City or Derby County.

Chelsea face a tricky test on the road at Wolverhampton Wanderers, who surprised Liverpool in the previous round, while Tottenham Hotspur will take on Fulham in a London derby.
Both Manchester clubs managed to avoid each other in the draw, which was performed by England manager Gareth Southgate and former BBC pundit Robbie Savage.
United have a short trip up the M66 to play Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, which, given the lure of the other ties, could be their first FA Cup game not chosen for live television coverage in 12 years.
City will be confident of progressing as they also make the short journey across the M62 to face Championship promotion chasers Huddersfield Town.

Guesses for TV picks



Ties at Sutton, Wolves, Burnley, Huddersfield are bolted on. One of BT Sport or BBC will go for Manchester United as well because it makes sense even if it's likely to be a dull match.

When is the draw for the next round of the FA Cup?
The draw for the fifth round of the FA Cup takes place on Monday Jan 30, 2017, just over 24 hours after the last game of the fourth round – Manchester United played Wigan Athletic – has concluded. The draw will get under way at around 7.20pm (GMT).

How can I watch the draw for the fifth round of the Cup?
The good news is the draw – that will feature England manager Gareth Southgate – will be broadcast on lovely free-to-air BBC One. The bad news, though, is that if you want to follow the draw on the telly box then you will have to endure the teeth-pulling misery that is the The One Show, which starts at 7pm. Alternatively, and you will thank us for this, follow all the action right here.
