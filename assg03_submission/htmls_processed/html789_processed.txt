His ban starts immediately so he misses Saturday's FA Cup game at Southampton. I the that tie needs a replay, it means Wenger will return for the Premier League game against Hull on 11 February.However, if the match is settled on Saturday, the Hull game will be the fourth and final one for which the Frenchman is banned, following Premier League games against Watford and Chelsea. The FA in a statement on its website wrote: "Arsene Wenger has been given a four-match touchline ban with immediate effect after he was charged for misconduct following Arsenal’s game against Burnley on Sunday 22 January 2017."It was alleged that in or around the 92nd minute, he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official."It was further alleged that following his dismissal from the technical area, his behaviour in remaining in the tunnel area and making physical contact with the fourth official amounted to improper conduct."The Arsenal manager, who was also fined £25,000, admitted the charge and requested a personal hearing which took place before an Independent Regulatory Commission today [Friday 27 January 2017]."Wenger reacted angrily to Burnley being awarded a 93rd-minute penalty at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, one they scored to level at 1-1.After being sent to the stands by referee Jon Moss, Wenger moved away from the pitch but stood at the tunnel entrance and refused to move as he tried to watch the remaining few minutes of Sunday's match.As Taylor encouraged him to move away, Wenger was seen to push back the foruth official. Immediately after the match, Wenger apologised.
