Chile Continues to Battle Its Worst Wildfires!
Firefighters and residents fought the fast-spreading blazes on the ground  while Russian and U.S. supertankers tried to quell a blaze that threatens the region of Navidad near the capital of Santiago.
Bachelet has called the widespread blazes the worst forest disaster in Chile's history. At least 11 deaths have been blamed on the fires.
The national forestry agency says the blazes have destroyed nearly 936,862 acres since Jan 15th.
At this moment 9 wildfires have been extinguished, 64 have been contained but 75 still  burn uncontrollably.  So far there are 6.162 victims of this terrible catastrophe and  1.551 homes have been destroyed.
For thousands of Chileans, the ferocity of the fires has left few options other than to try to get to a safe place and wait for the flames to pass. 
Chile needs support right now and after these fires have been extinguished to rebuild the country one more time, as we always do! Thank you very much for taking the time to help our country!

This is so sad!!! The worst wildfires in Chile's modern history completely consumed the town of Santa Olga.
Carlos Valenzuela, the mayor of Constitucion, said the fire service had abandoned Santa Olga in order to preserve their own lives due to the strength of the flames. He said that between 6,000 and 7,000 people in the region had lost their homes.
Residents of some communities have been battling the fires themselves, without any protective gear and often using just branches or bottles of water in a frantic effort to save their homes, pasture and livestock. But those efforts are often undone as winds or smouldering ash spread the fires anew.
