Arsene Wenger hit out at his critics after this emphatic win, saying some would claim a jail term was ‘too lenient’ for the Arsenal manager.
This was the first match of Wenger’s four-game touchline ban for his dismissal and pushing of fourth official Anthony Taylor in last Sunday’s win against Burnley.
It has been suggested he deserved a stadium ban, but Wenger said: ‘Those who don’t like me, any sentence will be too lenient. They would like to put me in jail somewhere, without anything, in the middle of winter — and that will still be lenient!   





Arsene Wenger watched on from the stands as he served the first of a four-game touchline ban

‘I do not want to judge what the judge says. I got a sentence and I decided not to appeal just to get this behind me.’
He was more forthcoming about his side’s forward options following Danny Welbeck’s two-goal display and a hat-trick for Theo Walcott. ‘Danny gives us more quality going forward,’ he said. 





In Wenger’s absence, former defender Steve Bould led Arsenal from the touchline

‘We had Lucas Perez and Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck and I had Alexis Sanchez on the bench, it is exceptional quality. For a long time we did not have the offensive quality available.’
Both managers made 10 changes and Saints boss Claude Puel said: ‘I’m responsible for this defeat. But if I had to pick the team again, I would do the same.’
