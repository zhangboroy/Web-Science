Karim Benzema in action for Real Madrid

Arsene Wenger has shot down speculation Arsenal could move for Karim Benzema.
The Gunners have long been linked with a move for the Frenchman and reports have suggested he is once again on their radar.
Benzema is reportedly no longer wanted at Real Madrid, with Spanish media outlets claiming he has been made available for a transfer this month.
But Wenger won’t be making any move for the 29-year-old.
“Because he is French,” Wenger said when asked why there is constant speculation surrounding Benzema and Arsenal.
“And maybe there are some noises that he would leave Madrid, but as I just told you, there is no need for us to buy any strikers.
“In the summer window? That’s not my worry at the moment. My worry is the next game against Watford.”
