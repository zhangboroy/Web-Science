Premier League 2016-17 new kits: See what Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal will wear next season

 In a totally scientific and not at all subjective approach, we've managed to order every kit from ugliest through to the best. 47. Third kit 2014-15 There is so much wrong with this kit. From the button down collar to the diagonal stripes and lime green trim, it's a monstrosity.

 37. Away 2007-08 (and third kit for 2008-09) Nice continuation of claret from the previous home kit, went well with the white.

 36. Third 2007-08 The collar is a bit big but again the claret looks good, especially with the gold trim. Barely warn in competitive games.

 33. Away 2008-09 A lovely ode to the 88-91 away kit. it also brings back memories of Andrey Arshavin's four-goal haul at Anfield.
