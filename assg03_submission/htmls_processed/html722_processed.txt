Miller and written by Jason Mosberg. The film stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Adrian Grenier, Johnathon Schaech, Christopher Coppola and Lydia Hull. The film was released on January 6, 2017, by Lionsgate Premiere. “Arsenal,” a pulpy crime drama about desperate characters and excessive carnage in Biloxi, Miss., is memorable primarily for some random scraps of loopy dialogue, the credible evocation of a sleazy demimonde rife with white-trash lawbreakers, and yet another Nicolas Cage performance that could be labeled Swift’s Premium and sold by the pound.Decked out in a putty nose, a bad wig, and a fake mustache that resembles an exhausted caterpillar, Cage plays a mood-swinging, coke-addled crime boss with the same manic gusto that lately has distinguished his work in scads of other easy-paycheck misadventures. (You could argue that, at this point, he is to 21st-century VOD fare what Wings Hauser was to ’80s direct-to-video quickies.) And while his over-the-top shtick is perilously nearing the end of its shelf life, Cage routinely dominates each film in which he appears, even when, as happens here, he is off screen for extended periods.Adrian Grenier and Johnathon Schaech are the nominal leads, competently playing disparate siblings whose frayed family ties are sorely tested by the machinations of Jason Mosberg’s screenplay. JT (Grenier), an upright family man who owns and operates a construction company, is committed to covering the back of his ne’er-do-well brother, Mikey (Schaech).A powerful action thriller, ARSENAL tells the intertwining stories of the Lindel brothers, Mikey and JP, who had only each other to rely on growing up. As adults, JP found success as the owner of a construction company, while Mikey became a small-time mobster, mired in a life of petty crime. When Mikey is kidnapped and held for a ransom by ruthless crime boss Eddie King, JP turns to the brothers’ old pal Sal, a plain clothes detective for help. In order to rescue his brother, JP must risk everything and unleash his vengeance against King’s relentless army of gangsters.Initial release: January 6, 2017 (USA) Director: Steven C.
