The Frenchman has hit back at those who have criticised his behaviour after he was sent to the stands in the late win over Burnley



Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has laughed off suggestions that he got off lightly with his four-game touchline ban and has claimed his critics would still gripe if he got "locked up without any heating".
West Ham fans fume over Payet tweet
Wenger received a four-match suspension after admitting a Football Association misconduct charge relating to an altercation with fourth official Anthony Taylor in their thrilling 2-1 win over Burnley.
Some claimed the Frenchman was fortunate to escape with just four matches from the stands, but Wenger believes there would have been discontent regardless of the severity of his punishment.
"I do not want to judge the judges. I got a sentence and I decided not to appeal to just get this behind me," Wenger was quoted as saying by The Guardian.

"For those who do not like me, any sentence will be too lenient.
Schweini proves a point to Mourinho
"They would like to put me in jail somewhere without any heating in the middle of winter and that would still be lenient."
Wenger sat out the first match of his ban in the 5-0 FA Cup win over Southampton at the weekend and will also miss the upcoming Premier League games against Watford, Chelsea and Hull City.
