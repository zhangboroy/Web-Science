Wikipedia describes a Meme as an activity, concept, catchphrase or piece of media which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet. There are so many hilarious ones but we picked just five representing local and international politics and sports.
Our number one is Trump’s inauguration which got so much bashing from all over the world but this caught our eye, ironically Ex-President Obama’s Father is Kenyan.
Number two we still go on politics with Jammeh taking a bit of jibe.
Number three is sporting with Chelsea FC coach Conte at the receiving end.
Number four is also sports related with Arsenal FC been taken apart.
Last for us this January is Big Brother Nigeria been shot in South Africa and compared to a President that is also not in town.
