Wenger - What I rate most about Bennacer












Ismael Bennacer may be disappointed to have been knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations, but Arsène Wenger believes he has a very promising future.
The young midfielder was a late call-up to the Algeria squad for the tournament, and while he did not play as the Greens were eliminated in the group stage, he will have gained useful experience.
Bennacer's Algeria knocked out of AFCON
Jonker - Bennacer has special qualities
Wenger is a big admirer of Bennacer and says he has all the attributes needed to make a big career in the game.
“He’s a player who is not spectacular, but a very efficient player,” the manager told Arsenal Player. “He’s the kind of player who, once you put him in the team, you don’t take him out anymore.
“He can defend very well, he’s a fighter, a left-footed player and very efficient going forward. He’s a real box-to-box player.
“He can do all kinds of jobs. He is still young, still lacks a little bit of experience, but is a very promising player.”
