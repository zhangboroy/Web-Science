Massimiliano Allegri





Juventus director Beppe Marotta has brushed off claims Arsenal are in talks with their manager Massimiliano Allegri over the possibility of him replacing Arsene Wenger in the summer.
The Gunners boss’ contract runs out at the end of the season at the Emirates and his future is still uncertain, leading to speculation over possible replacements.
According to the Sunday Express, Old Lady boss Allegri is their current target and report negotiations are at an advanced stage with the man who has won two title and two Coppa Italias since taking charge in July 2014.
But Marotta has responded to the claims, telling Mediaset: “Allegri has a contract with us and I reaffirm we have an excellent rapport which has brought us great success. We want to continue growing with him.
“Even without the fact there is a contract, there are no reasons to start creating problems. We are happy with him and he is happy with us.”
