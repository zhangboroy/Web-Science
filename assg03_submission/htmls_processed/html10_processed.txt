I have played over 10,000 puzzles without completing the main content.  Clearly, a lot of thought goes into the puzzle design.  So many objects repeat from scene to scene, but altered to be culturally appropriate  (cats, flowers, knives, shoes, fans, etc.).  The friend system has been fixed so it is easier to get friends, whoch makes free play easily possible.  However, I bought some crystals just to support the game.  Hint: spend your crystals on dinners - they are they best use because they increase your maximum energy forever.  Have fun!                    Carolyn McGee          I had been playing for a couple of years and enjoyed playing the game a lot! I enjoyed visiting my friends everyday and sending them gifts too! The real bummer tho is my phone crashed. I was able to get everything back on to my new phone except for this game. Something needs to be done about that BIG TIME! Especially since I got it off of Google Play Store.                            Tea corner update. The timer that counts down task time is moving ultra fast. I will not have 27 days left to complete the task if this continues. This update caused this problem as I did not have this happen before this. There needs to be another update that corrects this as I am sure that I am not the only person that has downloaded this update. No I will not create an 'issue ticket', I have already told you the problem. Why does this happen ?                    Bobbi Bellchambers          I like this game. Lots of levels and tasks to complete. Clearly a lot of thought put into it. I like that there isn't a constant pressure to buy added extras also, as that often puts me off. My only negative view is the short amount of time you get to try and complete the gem match puzzles... it gets frustrating.                    Denise Andress          I love the game. Would've given it a 5, except the game started over on me. All my awards experience energy, everything got lost. I sent an email to no avail. Have reinstalled and contue to love it. I only have access to 28 puzzles. Are more coming soon?                    Rena Edwards          I was on level 70+, when I switched phones and the game wouldn't transfer to my new phone to start all over!  This was the first game I downloaded when I got my first smart phone!  Very disappointing that it wouldn't pick up where I left off!!

Charette  February 13, 2017                       Just love this game, sooo addictive, have been playing for a very long time now and still love it. ONLY THING a bit long to recharge energy because I want to play more. Thank you đđ   Full Review                    Sadie Jim  February 16, 2017                       Love the game! Only thing for me is I cannot remove people  who don't play anymore.  They are the ones on my Facebook friends.  I tried looking them up but they are not on my Facebook anymore.

However, I recently reset my phone and had to start over from the beginning. Is there any way to recover my previous level?   Full Review                    Chi DiBona  February 13, 2017                       I had to take away stars due to issue with changing phones. I assumed you guys would've found a way to save our play. Like when we change phones, if we've logged into fb before, it can being us back to where we were. This is beyond frustrating if you've been playing for a yr, then switch phones... you lose EVERYTHING and are back to level 1. This is about the 3rd time this has happened to me.   Full Review                    Diane Starling  February 13, 2017                       Used to be my favorite game until all my game friends disappeared!

My only issue is that l got a new phone today and lost all of my years of progress. That sucks!   Full Review                    Peggy Matthews  February 16, 2017                       Secret Society, quite the addiction. Love it! I love the seasonal/holiday quests. Only complaint is the occasional glitch in recieving items.

Too addictive!!!   Full Review                    February 18, 2017                       I wish there was a way to write a note when trying to friend another player....and I also would like to see 2 things in future upgrades: 1) some sort of "i" tab that gives info like how the power to help friends works...how much power you start with and how much you use helping friends, and 2) somewhere you can see the profile others see about yourself....   Full Review                    Robin Brown  February 13, 2017                       Fun seekers game. Never know what you might find. The Orangery is lovely and the Tea Room serene. This game just keeps getting better!   Full Review                    Robyn Hooper  February 18, 2017                       Sp having had to start from scratch again was annoying but I did. Now all my  friends have disappeared. If I add new ones they disappear too.  Very disappointed   Full Review       G5 Entertainment March 21, 2016  Hi Robyn! We are so sorry to learn that you've experienced issues playing our game. Please contact our Customer Support Team at support@g5e.com. We'll be glad to assist you. Thanks!                  Parrots and Penguins  February 15, 2017                       The green match puzzle is impossible, and will cause you to waste your money trying to beat levels that don't give you anywhere near enough time. It wastes precious seconds on animations, and you might use a tool (which cost money) only to find that the animation took too long and you lost. Thanks for your purchase, here is some frustration and anger.   Full Review                    Michele Kirkwood  February 18, 2017                       Game is ok. I don't know about the iPhone, but with the Android you can't save your game progress. So if you get a new device, you can't pick up where you left off. You loose all of your coins, crystals, experience points, levels, friends & any other progress you've made.   Full Review                    Jen Sims  February 15, 2017                       I love this game. Many different ways to play and lots of different things to do.

Full Review                    Alaina unicorns  February 19, 2017                       I love the game! My one and only thing is when I zoom, I wish it was just a little bit clearer. Other than that, it's amazing. Very addicting.   Full Review                    Susan Graves  February 14, 2017                       Just started game rate higher later. Back using.
