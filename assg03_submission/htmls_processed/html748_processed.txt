It may seem a bit odd to think of people as weapons, but one of the best weapons we can have when dealing with migraine is a strong health care team. I think of the members of my health care team as my very special personal weapons. Without them, I'm really not sure where I'd be today. They've helped me get back from chronic migraine to episodic migraine — more than once!
 
Migraine is a genetic neurological disease for which, at this time, there is no cure. Some people experience only a handful of migraines in a lifetime. Unfortunately, other people can experience migraines far more frequently. We can develop chronic migraine, and some people go through periods of time with daily migraines. It's generally recommended that if we have three or more migraine attacks per month, or if our migraine attacks are especially severe or debilitating, we consider preventive therapies. That means that some of us need to treat migraine as we would any other disease that impacts us so significantly — diabetes, thyroid disease, asthma, etc. This means that we need to partner with a great health care team.

Although it can be difficult to acknowledge and accept migraine as a life-long disease for which we'll need regular medical care, that's the reality for some of us. To a great extent, how much migraine impacts our lives is up to us. It's up to us to learn about migraine disease and assemble our health care team. With an effective team, we can make great strides toward better migraine management and a higher quality of life.
 
Who we need on our health care team depends on several factors including how much our primary care physicians understand and are able to treat migraine, the frequency and severity of our migraine attacks, and any comorbid conditions we may have. For more on assembling your health care team and who should be included on your team, see Building Our Best Migraine Health Care Team.
