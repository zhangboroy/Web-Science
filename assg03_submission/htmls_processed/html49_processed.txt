Road to Zel

ARSENAL midfielder Gedion Zelalem has joined Dutch second tier side VVV-Venlo on loan until the end of the season, but he doesn’t look too pleased about it.
The 19-year-old claimed he was “very happy” on his arrival in Holland, but his body language told a different story.

Zelalem looked away from the camera and refused to give anything other than monotone two and three word answers.

The American Under-23 international helped Rangers to promotion last season and looked like he would have been far happier returning to Ibrox for the rest of this campaign.
When asked when he was signing the contract, he said: “Soon.”
The reporter then asked if he was happy, and he said: “Yeah, very happy.”
And he was told it was a good opportunity, to which he responded: “Yeah, very good.”

Wenger has praised Zelalem, who grabbed eight assists for Mark Warburton’s men last season, but claimed he needs to develop physically before he is ready for the Premier League.
The Gunners boss said: “He might be a bit longer to mature because he is a little bit behind on the body structure.
“I’m sure he will be a great player who matures maybe a bit slowly physically. But overall, I’m convinced that he’ll have a great career.”
