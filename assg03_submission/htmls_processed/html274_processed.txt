Arsenal Youngster Set to Complete Loan Deal With League One Outfit Charlton Before Transfer Deadline

​Young Polish defender Krystian Bielik looks set to be loaned out by Arsenal to League One side Charlton Athletic before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Tuesday, according to reports on the ​Star.
The teenager joined the Gunners for an estimated £2.7m back in January 2015 but had to wait until the following October to make his debut, coming on as a substitute in Arsenal’s shock League Cup defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. 


He is yet to make his full debut for the club and has featured just once more for the first-team, again coming on as a substitute during this season’s EFL Cup campaign. 
Although Bielik is highly thought of at the Emirates, his chances of breaking into Arsene Wenger’s team are slim and he now looks set to be loaned out to Charlton for the rest of the season, in a bid to give him some much-needed game time. 
The only thing currently preventing his move to the Addicks is Wenger himself, who has yet to sanction the move, although it appears unlikely the Frenchman would stand in the youngster’s way. 



The 19-year-old can play both in defence and central midfield, but with the calibre of talent currently in the Arsenal squad, he will need to stake his claim playing in League One. 
Karl Robinson’s team are currently sat in 11th place in the table, but caused something of an upset last weekend by winning away to promotion hopefuls Bolton Wanderers. The Addicks are six points off of a promotion spot themselves and may well fancy their chances of getting into one of the coveted positions as the season enters a crucial period.
