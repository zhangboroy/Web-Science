Danny Welbeck celebrates his goalscoring return to the Arsenal team

Arsene Wenger has confirmed fit-again Danny Welbeck will be left out of Arsenal’s starting line-up for their must-win clash with Watford this week.
The England forward made a goalscoring return from injury with a stunning display’ in their weekend FA Cup thrashing of Southampton.
Welbeck netted twice in a brilliant 5-0 win at St Mary’s – where Wenger made a total of ten changes to his starting line-up.
But the Gunners boss revealed that the former Manchester United man is not ready to play three games in a week, having only just returned to first team action.
The French coach revealed: “With Welbeck we have to be cautious with him as we are not sure how we can use him every three days. He is a bit short for that.
“Of course he has done enough to keep his place, but I think he needs another month of playing before [we can say he is fully fit.]”
While Welbeck will have to wait for his first home start of the season, Wenger is likely to recall fit again Olivier Giroud for Tuesday night’s visit of Watford as well as Mesut Ozil, with Alexis Sanchez recalled from the start having played as a substitute at Southampton.
