Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has given his strongest indication yet about when he’ll decide on signing a new contract at the Emirates Stadium.

The Frenchman has been in charge of the Gunners since 1996, but is heading towards the end of his current contract and seems no closer to renewing.
Wenger has divided opinion among Arsenal fans down the years, with many feeling he should have stepped down some time ago.

However, with Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil also stalling over new deals, Arsenal could do with the stability of keeping their long-serving manager on board.
Providing a latest update on his future, the 67-year-old suggested that he will set himself a deadline of April to decide his future.

‘I always said that I will judge where I stand in spring and make my decisions then. And the club is free as well. It’s not because I am here a long time that I have any rights. We are both on the same boat,’ he explained.
‘The club are happy and it will not affect planning. There are plenty of managers who arrived at the end of their contract. It happened to me before. I signed sometimes in March, April for longer contracts. So I don’t think it’s a problem.
‘I worked everywhere I was until the last day of my contract with total commitment. That’s why maybe I can go back everywhere I was, because people respect that.’
