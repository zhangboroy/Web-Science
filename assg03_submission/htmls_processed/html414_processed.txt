INTER WANT CROCKED VIDAL



Despite Aleix Vidal looking like he will miss the rest of Barcelona's season, Inter are preparing a summer move for the injured player, according to a report from GazzaMercato.
The right-back, who made just five starts for the Catalan club before picking up an ankle injury, was also a target for the San Siro side in the January transfer window as they look to re-build their squad.


LEICESTER FIND THEIR NEXT VARDY



Leicester City have taken non-league striker Joshua Gordon on trial as they search for the next Jamie Vardy, ESPN reports.
The 22-year-old is top scorer at Stafford Rangers, who played in the seventh tier of English football, and has previously been tracked by Championship side Derby County.


MAN CITY TARGET MENDY



Manchester City are keeping an eye on Benjamin Mendy as they look to sign a new left-back, ESPN reports.
The Premier League club are in the market for a new defender and are said to have sent scouts to watch the 22-year-old. Mendy, a first-team regular at Monaco, will have the chance to impress Pep Guardiola in next week's Champions League last-16 encounter. 


BAYERN TO SWOOP FOR DEMBELE



Bayern Munich are prepared to make a £30 million offer for Celtic star Moussa Dembele during the close season, The Daily Record claims. 
The 20-year-old attacker has been in excellent form for the Glasgow side since joining from Fulham at the start of the season. With 27 goals in 41 games for Brendan Rodgers' side, Dembele has attracted interest from the Premier League, but the Bundesliga champions are preparing a big bid to try to bring him to Bavaria.


MAN CITY PLOT £100m MESSI BID



Manchester City are lining up a sensational £100 million offer for Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, reports the Daily Mirror.
With uncertainty surrounding the Argentine's future at Camp Nou, Pep Guardiola has made a player he has enjoyed considerable success with in the past his top summer target.


LIVERPOOL BACK IN FOR CHILWELL



Liverpool will rekindle their interest in Leicester City defender Ben Chilwell when the transfer window re-opens, claims the Express.
The Reds have been monitoring the England U21 international for some time and hope to take advantage of the struggles being endured at the King Power Stadium.


MAN UTD LINING UP OX SWOOP



Manchester United are prepared to pay £30 million for Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, according to the Daily Mirror.
Jose Mourinho is looking to bolster an area of his squad that lost Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay in January and one that could see Michael Carrick depart at the end of his contract.


REDS OPEN GOTZE TALKS



Liverpool have opened discussions regarding a summer swoop for Borussia Dortmund forward Mario Gotze, according to the Daily Mirror.
The World Cup winner has previously worked with Jurgen Klopp in Germany and will cost around £20 million, with Dortmund paying that to re-sign him from Bayern Munich.


DONNARUMMA TO LAND NEW DEAL



AC Milan are prepared to offer in-demand goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma a bumper pay raise in an effort to fend off interest in his services, reports Calciomercato.
Chelsea and Juventus are among those to have been linked with the talented teenager, but Milan intend to table a five-year deal worth €2 million-a-year to keep a prized asset at the San Siro.


BARCA SEEK VIDAL REPLACEMENT



Barcelona have lined up three possible replacements for the injured Aleix Vidal, according to a report in AS.
Right-back Vidal's season has been ended by an ankle injury and the Catalans are said to have identified Deportivo La Coruna's Juanfran, Malaga's Roberto Rosales and Valencia star Joao Cancelo has potential solutions.


ROONEY COULD LEAVE THIS MONTH



Wayne Rooney could leave Manchester United before the close of the Chinese transfer window at the end of February, according to the Daily Telegraph.
A lucrative summer move to Asia has seemed more likely for the England captain but several Chinese Super League clubs are trying to strike a deal sooner.


CHELSEA IN DAHOUD CHASE



Chelsea are among those planning a summer approach for Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud, according to The Guardian.
The Germany international is a much sought-after talent, with Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain also said to be in the hunt.


ROMA WANT LINDELOF



Manchester United face competition from Roma for the signature of Benfica defender Victor Lindelof, according to TuttoMercatoWeb.
The Serie A side see the Sweden international has the perfect replacement for Kostas Manolas, who is set to leave the club in the summer for either Juventus or Inter Milan.


SOLANKE TO LIVERPOOL?



Dominic Solanke could leave Chelsea to join Premier League rivals Liverpool at the end of the season as the Blues refuse to pay his £50,000-a-week wages, according to The Sun. 
The 19-year-old's current contract expires this summer and he is keen to leave for Anfield in a deal worth around £8 million in place of a switch to Celtic.


BAYERN JOIN BELOTTI RACE



Bayern Munich have been in contact with Torino over striker Andrea Belotti, La Stampa reports.
The likes of Arsenal and Juventus have also been linked with the forward, who is one of the hottest properties in Serie A after a superb campaign to date.
