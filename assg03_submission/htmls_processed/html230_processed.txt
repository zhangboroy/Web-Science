football Arsenal To Battle Manchester United For Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann At £85million

Arsenal will slug it out with Manchester United in bid to sign Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann.
Arsenal failed in a bid to sign the Atletico Madrid striker after Euro 2016.
Though Manchester United believe they are in the forefront of getting Griezmann’s signature, Arsene Wenger will challenge Jose Mourinho in bringing the Frenchman to Emirates. Arsenal were denied earlier because Griezmann had just extended his contract with Atletico until 2021.





Arsenal’s approach was made in the knowledge that the player would cost £85million his release clause and an unrealistic fee for Arsenal to spend. United have this conviction they are in pole position to land the Madrid Ace, having his fellow Frenchman Paul Pogba to persuade him to join him at Old Trafford.
The Athletico star was recently voted third best player in the world coming behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
