Wenger wants Arsenal players to prove him right

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants his players to prove their worth after deciding against strengthening his squad this month. 
It has been a quiet transfer window at the Emirates, with Wenger bringing in no players of note and that is unlikely to change.
The Frenchman gave many of his fringe players a chance to shine at Southampton on Saturday and was rewarded with a 5-0 win.
Danny Welbeck scored a brace, with Theo Walcott adding a hat-trick as the likes of Petr Cech, Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez were rested from the starting line-up.
That quartet are expected to return for Tuesday's Premier League clash at home to Watford with the transfer window closing soon after full-time and Wenger, who will serve the second of a four-game touchline ban against the Hornets, insists he will not spring a surprise between now and then.

"Yes, of course," Wenger said when asked if his squad's strength influenced his thinking during the transfer market.
"It's not only to buy players, you have to have a need in your squad first of all. I believe that number-wise and quality-wise, we have what is required to do well.
"Now it's down to us to perform and to produce with the quality of our focus, the quality of our ambition and desire to produce the performance in every single game."
Wenger said Arsenal would mirror most Premier League clubs by doing very little business in the final hours of the window, with his only addition this month having been young left-back Cohen Bramall from Hednesford Town.
"(It will be) very quiet. On our front, we have a big squad," he said.
"We are not in need of buying. On a general front it has been very quiet. That shows that there are not many players available who can strengthen English teams.
"It also shows that all the teams in England, especially the big teams, have big squads. That's why not a lot happened."
