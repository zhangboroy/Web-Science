Rio Ferdinand says Arsenal and Tottenham can catch Chelsea 


Antonio Conte’s Chelsea are eight points clear of second-placed Arsenal, with Tottenham one point back.
Liverpool and Manchester City are even further behind and Ferdinand can’t see any of them catching the Blues in the remaining 16 games.
Jurgen Klopp’s Reds take on Chelsea on Tuesday at Anfield but the Manchester United legend can’t see that result having a big impact in the title race.

Rio Ferdinand on Premier League title race

 
“There are ways of getting at Chelsea,” he wrote in The Times.
“There’s space behind their wing-backs.
“But they have the know-how to get a result at Anfield.





       
    
    

“If Liverpool don’t win, they’re out of the title race – though in reality I see Arsenal and Tottenham as the only clubs capable of overhauling Chelsea.
“Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are fighting it out below them.
“The title race is a matter for London. Fourth place is a battle for the northwest.”
