:v 3 days agoMduduzi Inxaba Shabangu - Remember very well well even in November 2915 when we won 5-1 Muller scored the 5th goal in the dying minutes. Robben can score a goal from nowhere, the defence does not have an influence on that goal cause the defenders are inside the box while Robben is out of the box. 4 days agoAl-mahdi Fejzula - I'm agree that when José Mourinho says for Arsene Wenger  master for failure...

but i rember the ball was rolled into Hierry Henry and Kolo from nowhere, smashed him from behind. It was a terrible tackle, a red card in a normal game, and our bast player was rolling around. Wenger was shouting ''Kolo what are you doing?'' Dont tackle! The next minute the ball was into Dennis Bergkamp and Kolo did the excatly the same. We were thinking '' We're trying to win the league and a trialist has taken out our two best players. Anyway, Wenger said '' No more tackling'' We went again, this time Kolo made a great tackle, the ball went up in the air and landed right at Arsene Wenger's feet, He was on the pitch watching the training. So next thing you know, Kolo took him out with a two footed tackle! All you could hear was Wenger screaming. He had to go back to the medical room, and the trialist had taken out Henry, Bergkamp and the manger!
