Arsenal News HQ brings you the latest Arsenal news, match analysis, transfer news, injury news, team news and rumours from trusted media outlets around the world.
Manchester City are still interested in signing Hector Bellerin, according to reports.
City tried to sign the defender in the last summer transfer window but he snubbed their interest to sign a contract extension with Arsenal.
The new contract is expected to keep the defender here until 2021 but that doesn’t seem to deter Guardiola.
According to the Times via the Daily Star, Bellerin is still high on Guardiola’s wish list.



The newspaper claims the former Barcelona boss wants to carry out a major overhaul of his playing staff at the end of the season and will try to tempt Bellerin away from the Emirates.
Guardiola worked with Bellerin at Barcelona’s La Masia academy before the player moved to the Emirates and the tactician is keen to reunite with the defender but I don’t see the possibility of that happening because i expect the player to stay here for many more years to come.
 City would be better off turning their attention elsewhere because it will be almost impossible to convince Wenger to sell a player who just signed a long term contract.
The defender isn’t keen on a move away from the Emirates either which will make it even more difficult for Guardiola and I don’t think City will be foolish enough to make an official bid.
Bellerin has been ever present in Arsenal’s fixtures this season and is expected to continue playing a key role in the future
