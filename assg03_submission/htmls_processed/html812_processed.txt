GETTYHow to watch Southampton v Arsenal in the FA CupAfter a long day of 4th Round FA Cup action the attention shifts to the evening kick-off, with Southampton hosting Arsenal for what is sure to be another incredible match between the two sides.Southampton come into the game off the back of a terrific 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday to secure their place in next month’s EFL Cup final.Arsenal meanwhile have endured a turbulent week, dominated by Arsene Wenger's four-match touchline ban, following a shove on fourth official Anthony Taylor during the Gunners dramatic 2-1 victory against Burnley last Sunday.Arsenal will also be wary of the Saints, having not only lost 2-0 in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup in November when Southampton visited the Emirates, but also with Painful memories of their 4-0 mauling from the season before still fresh in the mind.However, with a number of injuries and fatigue possibly playing a part, Saints boss Claude Puel has suggested that he may have to field a few players who fans may not have regularly seen in the first team line-up.“I’ll try to have a good balance between young and experienced players for this game.”
