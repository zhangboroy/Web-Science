The England striker, making his first start since May, hit goals and set up the first goal of Theo Walcott's hat-trick. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, beginning his four-game touchline ban for his push on fourth official Anthony Taylor last week, rose in the stands to applaud his star man. Welbeck's strikes, in the 14th and 21st minutes, were his first since he scored against Norwich last April. Walcott made it 3-0 on 35 minutes and finished off the League Cup finalists with goals in the 69th and . Both Wenger and Southampton boss Claude Puel made ten changes to their sides with Premier League games to come on Tuesday. Arsenal host Watford while Southampton travel to Swansea.

 Here are 5 things we learned: 1. Arsenal's increased firepower Sanchez, Giroud, Perez, a Walcott hat-trick and now Welbeck. Arsenal suddenly have firepower coming out of their ears going into the second half of the season. In fact, Welbeck is the reason why it could be different this year. The England marksman looked fit, sharp and clinical as he reduced the Saints to shreds by half time. Suddenly the options up front for Arsene Wenger looked better than they have done for some time. No wonder he has a big grin on his face even though he was sat in the stands after his push on the fourth official in the game against Burnley. A bit of perspective. Southampton were without Virgil van Dijk who is injured and Jose Fonte who is now at West Ham. In their place were young Jack Stephens and ring-rusty Florin Gardos. That said, Welbeck gave Arsenal fans all sorts of reasons to be optimistic going into the second half of the season.

 2. Saints need to do business One trip to Wembley will do for Southampton who face Manchester United in the League Cup Final on February 26. In that sense they will not cry too many tears over what was a convincing defeat at the hands of the Gunners here. That said, there are a few issues for Claude Puel to deal with ahead of Tuesday's transfer deadline. With Virgil van Dijk injured and Jose Fonte gone, Southampton urgently need at least one centre-half going into the second half of the season. They also need another striker. Charlie Austin is also on the sidelines and if Puel loses Shane Long for any length of time then he is up the creek. The next couple of the days could be very interesting at St Mary's.

 3. Wenger catches a break The Arsenal boss will know full well that he has caught a massive break with his ban of just four games for pushing the fourth official at the end of the game against Burnley last week. The message it sends down the leagues is not a positive one in terms of the protection of the men in black. All that aside, Wenger won't mind if the next three performances from his side are as convincing as this one. Twelve months ago Arsenal topped the table at the turn of the year, only to win just two of their subsequent nine to tumble out of title contention. This year, on the back of this result and with so much increased competition, the Gunners could yet defy their doubters.

 4. FA Cup still suffering As thrilling as this performance was from Arsenal, this was a contest to illustrate - along with so many others this weekend - just how much the romance of the FA Cup is suffering. To be fair to both these sides, neither could be blamed for the ten changes they made to their teams. Arsenal, chasing the title, host Watford on Tuesday night with the title very much the priority at the Emirates. In any case Arsene Wenger has proven his commitment to the FA Cup with two wins in the last three years. Southampton have already reached a Cup Final and could not possibly have been expected to field a strong side having expended so much physical and emotional energy against Liverpool on Wednesday night. They are also in Premier League action on Tuesday night, travelling to Swansea. The point is, the FA Cup has increasingly become the collateral damage as clubs chase other competitions. The talk about the romance is one thing. The reality is very different.

 5. Southampton still have a bright future With Chinese investment and a Cup Final to look forward the future is once again bright for Southampton. They are a club that holds their nerve and gives kids a chance. The academy continues to churn them out and the tenacity shown by Puel's young side here showed that he has something to work with. This result cannot be seen in isolation. With Les Reed at the helm and their new Chinese investors in the background the Saints could yet be strong enough to hold on to any future rising stars.
