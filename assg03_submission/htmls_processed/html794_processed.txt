Atletico Madrid player Koke raised eyebrows on Twitter last night when he hinted at a move to Arsenal.

The Spanish midfielder drew the ire of Atletico Madrid fans when he retweeted rumours and articles about himself transferring to Arsenal.

Yesterday, Diego Simeone told reporters that Koke would be staying and the club wasn't willing to sell the Spanish midfielder.

'Regardless of what Arsenal offer us, we are not going to sell Koke, as he is extremely important to the club and its ambitions for the future.'
