Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang wanted by Liverpool to replace Daniel Sturridge

 
Jurgen Klopp worked with the Gabon superstar at Borussia Dortmund and sees the striker as the ideal frontman for his Liverpool side.
However, the Mirror claim the Reds would face serious competition from Real Madrid, Chelsea and Arsenal for Aubameyang’s signature.
Dortmund director, Hans-Joachim Watzke, revealed that Aubameyang would be available for around £60 million putting the attacker’s suitors on red alert.
Liverpool will need a new striker in the summer with Klopp thought to have decided Sturridge no longer has a future at the club.
Sturridge has endured a difficult season in front of goal with just two goals in the Premier League and six in total for the season.




Klopp has handed Sturridge just five league starts this season, with the England international spending much of his time either on the bench or in the treatment room.
Aubameyang is one of the most lethal strikers in Europe with 20 goals in all competitions this season.
Real and London giants Arsenal and Chelsea are eager to add Aubameyang to their ranks and are set to spark a bidding war should Dortmund agree to sell.




Klopp is aware that securing Aubameyang will be a difficult task with so many big-spending sides desperate to sign him.
