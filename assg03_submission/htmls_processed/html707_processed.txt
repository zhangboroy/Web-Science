The Belgian attacker replaces Nolito in the starting XI as Pep Guardiola's side look to replace the effectiveness of their star attacker in Sunday's encounter at the Etihad Stadium







Kevin De Bruyne will start up front for Manchester City against Arsenal in the absence of suspended striker Sergio Aguero.
James: I could leave Real Madrid
Argentine attacker Aguero is still serving a four game suspension after his red card at the end of City's encounter with Chelsea, when he slid in dangerously on David Luiz.
Pep Guardiola has called upon Kelechi Iheanacho and Nolito to lead the attack in the last three games, but it is the team's most creative player who takes up the No.9 role this time.
While Aguero has scored 10 Premier League goals for City this season, De Bruyne has shown his effectiveness by getting eight assists. Guardiola will be hoping he can increase his current goal tally of two when they take on Arsenal though, with Raheem Sterling, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Leroy Sane in support of him.

John Stones has been left out of the starting XI once again, having also missed out on the midweek encounter against Watford, as Aleksander Kolarov keeps his place beside Nicolas Otamendi in the heart of the defence.
Arsenal, on the other hand, have made one change to the team that started in Tuesday's 2-1 loss to Everton, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is relaced by Alex Iwobi.
Manchester City XI: Bravo; Zabaleta, Otamendi, Kolarov, Clichy; Fernando, Sane, Toure, Silva, Sterling; De Bruyne
Arsenal XI: Cech; Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Xhaka; Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi; Alexis
