Hello and welcome to another day of Arsenal transfer news and rumours as the January window nears its conclusion.
It what could be huge news (if it's true), Arsenal are expected to challenge Manchester United for the signature of Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann, according to The Mail on Sunday.
We are told that the Gunners failed with an initial attempt to sign Griezmann last summer, with the Frenchman instead extending his contract with Atletico until 2021.





The top 100 targets in the January transfer window






United believe they are in pole position to capture the 25 year-old this summer but it seems Arsene Wenger will be given the £85 million it will take to sign the talented forward and then it will come down to wages.
The Mail adds that Chelsea have shown interest in Griezmann, while Manchester City also have the resources to offer a mega-bid. 
Should, as is likely, Grizemann leaves Atletico, The Sun on Sunday says the La Liga side will move for Alexis Sanchez and offer the Chile international around £220,000 per week in wages.

That, we are reminded, is a significant increase on the £160,000-a-week deal currently on offer for Sanchez to sign a new contract with the Gunners, although only half what Chinese clubs are dangling in front of him.
Arsenal are in 'advanced talks' with Juventus boss Max Allegri about replacing Wenger this summer, says The Sunday Express.

Questions continue as to whether Wenger's two-decade reign at the Emirates is set to end when his contract runs out at the end of the season.
The Express adds that discussions with Allegri are at an advanced stage but no agreement has yet been reached. RB Leipzig boss Ralph Hasenhuttl is also being considered if Allegri remains in Turin.

A re-cap of yesterday's news and rumours

The latest word emerging from the Emirates is that Cristiano Ronaldo is key to Arsenal's hopes of signing Karim Benzema. 
Arsenal have handed a trial to a Chilean teenage star dubbed "the next Alexis Sanchez" - Marcelo Allende.
Juventus have joined Arsenal in the race for Alvaro Morata.
Roma are hopeful their £25 million valuation of Argentina midfielder Leandro Paredes will tempt Arsenal to make a bid for the 22 year-old.
