THIS is the moment that sparked Watford’s incredible fightback to stun the showboating Hammers.
Dimitri Payet’s Rabona cross was headed home by Michail Antonio to put West Ham 2-0 ahead.

Watford’s players, who had already seen Manuel Lanzini try a Rabona shot from 20 yards, were not amused.
The Hornets promptly blasted four goals in a 22-minute spell either side of half-time.
And skipper Troy Deeney declared: “West Ham tried to mug us off. They started doing the flicks and the tricks after 30 minutes.
Watford come from behind to beat West Ham 4-2 at The London Stadium

“You can appreciate good skill and that was great skill for the second goal, but as a professional you cannot allow someone to do that to you.
“You see that in the playground with six and seven-year-olds, and we are grown men. I can appreciate a
Rabona when a team is 5-0 up with ten minutes to go but not when it makes it 2-0 and we’re still in the first half. It felt disrespectful.
“There were some harsh words said to each other and everyone had that fire in their belly again.

Check out West Ham stars Payet and Lanzini show off their skills against Watford
“So we need to thank them really. It got the boys up and running. They stoked our fire and before you knew it they started backing off.
“We were dominant in the second half and with no disrespect we bullied them. We won a lot more 50-50 tackles.”
Deeney was asked whether he had told French star Payet not to try the Rabona again.

		Troy Deeney celebrates the Watford comeback with Odion Ighalo	

The Watford striker said: “He’s a very talented player so if he wants to do that he can. But there are consequences.”
Those consequences were delivered in devastating fashion by the angry Hornets.
Antonio’s pair of headers had put the Hammers in cruise control.

		Deeney scored first goal of the season and celebrates	

But Odion Ighalo’s deflected shot and a gem of a chip from Deeney levelled matters.
Etienne Capoue rammed in No 3 and Jose Holebas fired the fourth.
Deeney went home happy after collecting shirts from Payet and Antonio.
He added: “I got Antonio’s shirt because I’ve played against him many times and I’ve got a lot of respect for him.

		Holebas scored Watford s fourth	

“Payet gave me his shirt as well because I’ve got a charity now and at the end of the season I’ll put them up for auction.
“I’m setting up the Troy Deeney Foundation and we hope to have all the details in place in the next few days.”
West Ham skipper Mark Noble said: “If we go in at half-time at 2-0 it’s a different game. But if you make mistakes in this league you get punished.”
