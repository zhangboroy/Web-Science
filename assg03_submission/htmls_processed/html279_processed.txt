Wenger on Benzema, transfers, Debuchy












With the January transfer window due to shut on Tuesday, it was no surprise that Arsène Wenger was asked about his approach during the final few days.
Having been linked with the likes of Karim Benzema, the boss discussed things with the media on Monday and this is what he had to say:
'Welbeck gives huge offensive potential'
'Niang will be an asset for Watford'
'He's a player with great attitude'
on how he would assess the transfer window…Very quiet. On our front, we have a big squad and we are not in need of buying. On a general front it has been very quiet. That shows that there are not many players available who can strengthen English teams. It also shows that all the teams in England, especially the big teams, have big squads. That’s why not a lot happened.
on if the Arsenal squad’s strength influenced his thinking…Yes, of course. It’s not only to buy players, you have to have a need in your squad first of all. I believe that number-wise and quality-wise, we have what is required to do well. Now it’s down to us to perform and to produce with the quality of our focus, the quality of our ambition and desire to produce the performance in every single game.
on if players’ form takes pressure off him not to buy…Yes. Welbeck’s return, the quality of all our players… on the offensive front we played with Lucas, Walcott and Welbeck. Giroud was not involved, Alexis was on the bench, Ozil did not play, so offensively we have a very strong squad.
on why he has been linked with Karim Benzema again…Because he’s French! Maybe there are some noises that he would leave Madrid, but as I just told you, there is no need for us to buy any strikers.
on whether he’d consider Benzema…In the summer window? That’s not my worry at the moment. My worry is the next game against Watford.
on if there have been any offers for Mathieu Debuchy…No.
on whether it’s still possible that Debuchy could leave before the deadline…It’s still possible, yes. He’s completely fit now and is back in full training.
on whether he’s surprised there are league games on deadline day…It’s not easy but all the big clubs, all the clubs in the Premier League now, are organised to have special departments who take care of transfers. Maybe the managers have a bit less of their eye on transfers than on the game, because they have a game to prepare for. But I believe that there are people now inside the clubs who take care of the transfers.
on trying to arrange medicals while the squad are travelling…That’s a bit more difficult, yes. Anyway, on the last day of the transfer window it’s always complicated to do a medical. And it’s always a bit superficial.
