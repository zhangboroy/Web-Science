 But should they progress, he will be missing for the crunch clash with Chelsea in the Premier League on February 4, as he will have to stay for either the third-place play-off, which takes place on the same date, or the final. If the injury rules him out of those games, he will likely return to England for treatment. Arsenal are free of serious injuries at the moment with Santi Cazorla the only other name currently on the treatment table.
