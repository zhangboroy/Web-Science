Better defence than Chelsea? Chris Hughton’s Brighton have most clean sheets in England
Aston Villa were also interested in the the England Under-21 star, who was part of Steve Bruce’s Hull City side which won promotion to the Premier League last season, though the Gunners forward has decided on a move to the South Coast with the second division leaders.
Akpom struck on seven occasions in all competitions for the Tigers, with three of those coming in the league, but has endured a difficult campaign back at the Gunners this season following a back problem.

Chris Hughton is looking to add competition to his attacking unit before the end of the January window, with only Glenn Murray and Tomer Hemed to choose from in terms of first-team strikers due to an injury to Sam Baldock.

Akpom has made just four first-team appearances for Arsenal since his breakthrough at the Emirates in 2013, spending time on loan at Brentford, Coventry, Nottingham Forest and latterly Hull.
