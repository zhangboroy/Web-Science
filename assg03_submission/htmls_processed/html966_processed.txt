Arsenal are ready to challenge Manchester United to the signing of Antoine Griezmann, according to The Mail on Sunday.

Manchester United are said to be leading the race to sign the £85 million rated striker who was voted the third best in the world over the last year.


Having made an initial approach to sign the France international in the summer, Arsenal are reportedly ready to match his release clause, though the Red Devils are expected to have the upper hand when it comes to wages.

Arsenal would need to pay more than £250,000 a week to land a player of his calibre, despite failing to offer the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil such sums.

Griezmann, who helped carry France to the finals of Euro 2016, is considered one of the best players in the world and is the currently a fans favourite at Atletico Madrid.
