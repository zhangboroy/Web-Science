Arsène Wenger has received a four-match touchline ban, according to the good folks at Times Sport. The ban comes as punishment for Wenger shoving the fourth official during last week’s win against Burnley. 
Wenger’s ban will come into effect immediately. Most worryingly, he is now set to miss the pivotal away match at Chelsea, which is in a little over a week and more or less a must win if we are to have any hope at winning the league. 
The other matches Wenger must miss are an FA Cup tie with Southampton and league matches against Watford and Hull. With Wenger’s ban and Arsenal’s midfield a bit, shall we say, down in the dumps, these next four matches have the potential to be rather brutal viewing for Arsenal fans. 
In Wenger’s defense, though, the refereeing was pretty awful in the Burnley match. Anyways, with our noble leader banned, assistant manager Steve Bould will likely take control of the touchline during this stretch. In the meantime, lease enjoy this amusing tweet to lift your spirits.
