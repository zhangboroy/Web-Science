I couldn't be more wrong. The updates have improved the graphics, the slick interaction with the players. Makes this extremely addictive. Only downside is tickets and coins are unattainable, unless you buy the expensive packs. The update version 6.0. At first glance you set high standards.

Thank you so much :)                  Yash R  November 7, 2016                      Why do this app need all this access? I installed this app but it's asking me access to my text messages and phone calls... Why exactly do you need this for a game?......... Ace! Thank you for the answer. Looking forward to this game! Let me try it and review back. 4 stars for answering for now :-)   Full Review       CYBIRD November 6, 2016  Dear Yash R,
The app asks for two permissions: first one is access to the phone memory in case you want to save a screenshot of the game (the game can't do that without your authorization); the second one to your phone calls, so the app pauses itself and give priority to the call is somebody calls you while playing, and nothing more :)                  ShadowGamerHD  November 2, 2016                      So many problems The gameplay is good and so are the graphics but when the load times, music and scout system are so bad its hard to enjoy the game. The scout system does not let you use tickets that I own and does not prioritize tickets like it should. Needless to say I am not pleased.. May have to uninstall.   Full Review       CYBIRD November 3, 2016  Dear ShadowGamerHD,
You can turn the music off in the options if you want to :) And you can actually choose which tickets you want to use at the scout screen, the game will by default use the "My" tickets, but you can untick that box! I hope this makes your experience with BFB Champions better!                  William Chan  November 11, 2016                      So so.. Good chibi graphics and easy game play. But the mechanics, player position settings, player draw rate and game info is really so so... i have no idea how this skills are activated and how stats affect player and the game play...
