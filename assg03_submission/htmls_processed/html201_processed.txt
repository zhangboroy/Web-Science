Arsenal plan £85m bid to beat Man United to Antoine GriezmannplayRumour Rater: Pogba luring Griezmann? (3:02)Steve Nicol has his say at the latest rumours, including Man United's reported attempt for Antoine Griezmann. (3:02)FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailcommentJan 29, 2017ESPN StaffCloseFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailcommentThe winter transfer window is now in full swing! As usual, Transfer Talk has its finger on the pulse when it comes to which rumours are picking up steam. Check out all the latest deals here.TOP STORY: Gunners in for shock Griezmann moveIn news that could send shockwaves through the next transfer window, Arsenal appear ready to fight Manchester United for the signature of Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann.The Mail reports that Arsene Wenger will sanction an £85 million bid on the France international, thus triggering the player's release clause.It has been revealed that the Gunners made an optimistic move last summer, which stumbled when the 25-year-old penned a new deal until 2021 with Los Colchoneros.Paul Pogba is thought to be campaigning on behalf of the Red Devils and while Griezmann can expect greater wages at Old Trafford, the former Real Sociedad starlet would warrant shattering the wage structure at the Emirates in a surprise move.Arsenal would be prepared to fork out as much as £250,000-per-week as they stake their case to capture the best player of 2016 not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.MAIL SPORT: Race for Griezmann #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/d2b3eMa69L- Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) January 28, 2017But that's not where the intrigue ends.While Griezmann will almost certainly leave Atleti, the Sun believes that the La Liga giants will try to persuade Alexis Sanchez to join Diego Simeone's squad.Atleti will tempt the Chilean with £220,000-per-week wages to swap London for Madrid.That would represent a £60,000-per-week increase in his wages at the Emirates, with a £35m offer being readied to tempt Arsenal into selling -- and making a £2m profit on -- the former Barcelona star.LIVE BLOG:22.00 GMT: That's going to bring Sunday's live edition of Transfer Talk to a close.
