ARSENE WENGER has warned Carl Jenkinson he must “find happiness” if he is to leave Arsenal – and that Mathieu Debuchy could exit this transfer window.
The Gunners boss confirmed any move for right-back Jenkinson would be permanent, but that none have been forthcoming so far.

		Carl Jenkinson must find happiness at a new club if he is to leave, says Arsene Wenger	

Deals stop when the window shuts tomorrow night at 11pm.

Read Arsene Wenger’s press conference as it happened in the SunSport blog

And though Wenger said he is still open to selling the 24-year-old – who has not played since November 30 – he warned Jenkinson he must be comfortable where he ends up.
The former Charlton kid has been linked with a cross-London transfer to Crystal Palace.
And Wenger said: “There is no news about Carl Jenkinson. We are still open to a move but it doesn’t look like something will happen.
“He is integrated in our squad. There is no problem with his attitude. He must find happiness with conditions and where he goes.”

Out-of-favour Debuchy - who Wenger confirmed is once again fully fit - has been trying to get a return to France.
And Wenger, whose side face Watford at home tomorrow night, insisted he will not stand in his way should he want to leave.
The Emirates chief said of his fellow countryman: "It is still possible he could go. He is completely fit and back in contention."
