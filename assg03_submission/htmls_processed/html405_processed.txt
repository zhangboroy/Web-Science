Wenger reacts to Benzema to Arsenal reports with classic response






The Gunners boss has played down links to the Real Madrid striker, suggesting that the only reason he is being discussed is because he is French
 
Arsenal manager has sought to play down the latest rumours linking Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema with a move to Arsenal.
The France international has long been mooted as a target for the Gunners, but the man in charge at Emirates Stadium believes the ongoing speculation is driven purely by nationality.
When quizzed on why he thinks Benzema is generating transfer talk once again, Wenger said: “Because he is French and maybe there is a bit of noise that he could leave Madrid.”
Zidane: Benzema having a great season
The 29-year-old has incurred the wrath of Real supporters of late, with the Santiago Bernabeu faithful less than impressed by his contribution to the collective cause.
There have been calls for him to be dropped by Zinedine Zidane, with Alvaro Morata considered to be more deserving of a regular starting role.
That has helped to spark further exit speculation, but Wenger is adamant that he has no need to bolster his attacking options.

He saw Danny Welbeck get back into the goalscoring groove in a FA Cup clash with Southampton over the weekend, in a fixture which also saw Theo Walcott net a hat-trick.
Olivier Giroud has impressed over recent months, while Alexis Sanchez remains a talismanic figure and Lucas Perez a useful option to have in reserve.
Wenger: My critics would like to jail me
Wenger added: “There is no need for us to buy any strikers.
“On our front, we have a big squad and don’t need to buy.
“I believe that numbers and quality wise we have what is required.”
Lauren: How Arsenal became invincible
While eager to distance himself from Benzema and possible striking additions, Wenger has hinted that there could be no further movement on the incomings front at the Emirates across the board.
He said: “It has been quiet and that shows there are not many players available that can strengthen English teams,” he added.

“It is not only to buy players. You have to have a need in your squad.”
The Frenchman was also unable to clarify whether Carl Jenkinson will be heading for the exits before the deadline passes, with the defender’s proposed move to Crystal Palace having stalled.
‘The Ox is playing like Pirlo’
“There’s no news about him at all,” he said. “
We’re still open [to offers] because we have many players in his position but at the moment it doesn’t look like something will happen.
“[The Palace deal] isn’t dead for us, no. For him, I don’t know. He’s integrated, we respect any professional decision. He’s a great player with a great attitude, there’s no problem on that front. After that, he must find happiness.”
