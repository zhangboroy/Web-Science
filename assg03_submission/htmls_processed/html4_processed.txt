 Kim Kallstrom 
Club agrees loan move for Kim Kallstrom












Swedish international midfielder Kim Kallstrom has joined Arsenal on loan from Russian side Spartak Moscow until the end of the 2013/14 season.
The 31-year-old arrives at Arsenal with a wealth of experience, having made 108 international appearances for Sweden and over 400 club appearances during his career so far, in which he has played league football in Sweden, France and Russia.
Kallstrom started his career in 1999 with Swedish side BK Hacken. After spending two years at the Gothenburg club, the midfielder moved to Djurgardens IF, where he won the Swedish League in both 2002 and 2003, together with the Swedish National Cup in 2002.


I’m here to do my best for Arsenal and to help out the team, so we can achieve good results for the last part of the season
Kim Kallstrom

Following two years at Djurgardens IF, Kallstrom moved to France where he spent eight successful years, firstly with Rennes for two seasons, before moving to Lyon, where he enjoyed much success.
During his time with ‘OL’, Kallstrom made over 200 appearances, winning the Ligue 1 title twice (2006/07, 2007/08), the French National Cup twice (2008, 2012) and the French Super Cup twice (2007, 2008). He was also a regular in the Uefa Champions League, helping Lyon to the semi-final of the competition in 2009/10.
Vastly experienced at international level, the midfielder was part of his country’s squads at four major tournaments - the European Championships in 2004, 2008 and 2012, and the 2006 World Cup.
Arsène Wenger said: “Kim Kallstrom is a hugely-experienced player. He is a midfielder with proven quality at both club and international level. We welcome Kim to Arsenal.”
Kallstrom spoke to Arsenal Media as he completed the move and said: “Arsenal is an amazing club with a lot of great players and a coach who has done really well here for a long time. I am so pleased to come here to learn as much as possible. I’m here to do my best for Arsenal and to help out the team, so we can achieve good results for the last part of the season.”
Although Kallstrom has appeared for Spartak Moscow in this season's Europa League at the play-off stage, when they were eliminated by Swiss club St.Gallen, he will be eligible for Arsenal for the remainder of this season’s Champions League campaign.
Kim Kallstrom’s squad number will be revealed on the Club’s official Twitter feed @Arsenal soon.
Everyone at Arsenal welcomes Kim to the Club and wishes him every success during his time here.
The loan move is subject to the completion of standard regulatory processes.
