Arsene Wenger has played down reports linking Arsenal with a surprise move for Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema.
Reports in Spain have suggested that Madrid are ready to offload the France international and have offered Arsenal and Chelsea the chance to sign the 29-year-old.
Asked why the Gunners are constantly linked with Benzema, Wenger replied: ‘Because he’s French.
‘Maybe there are some noises that he would leave Madrid, as I told you, there’s no need to buy a striker.’
Asked if Arsenal would consider a move if Benzema were to be made available at the end of the season, Wenger said: ‘In a summer window, that’s not my worry at the moment.’

Wenger also reiterated that Arsenal, along with the rest of the Premier League title challengers, have found it difficult to find high quality players available this month.
‘On our front we have a big squad, we are not in a need to buy,’ said the Frenchman.
