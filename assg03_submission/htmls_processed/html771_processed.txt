Reports: Arsenal back in for Mario Balotelli.


Posted 19 Feb 2017 by Sara Davidson.


Reports have emerged that Arsenal have renewed their interest in Liverpool star Mario Balotelli.

This is despite earlier statements from manager Arsene Wenger, who told reporters that he had no intention in pursuing the former AC Milan striker.

'Arsenal are looking to swoop in on Balotelli with an €30 million offer', stated one source.

'And with Balotelli looking to leave Liverpool, it looks as though it might actually happen.'
