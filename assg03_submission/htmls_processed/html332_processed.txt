It’s that bi-annual time when Arsene Wenger declares that his squad is perfectly good enough as it already is – and therefore, by extension, he does not need to even consider signing anyone in the transfer window.
“On our front we have a big squad and are not in need to buy,” Wenger said.
“And on [the] January front it has been quiet and that shows the players available that can strengthen English teams are not many and the English teams have big squads.”
Inevitably, Wenger’s latest vote of confidence in his current players did not go down at all well with fans, many of whom believe his existing squad is only really good enough to achieve what the club always achieves.

So Wenger confirms no January signings he is obviously happy with the mediocrity of this very underachieving side #wengerout #Arsenal

Wenger will sign no one this window. Sanchez & Ozil will sign. We will be told these are as good as new signings #Wengology

Even fans of other clubs are starting to feel a bit sorry for supporters of the Gunners with fears Jurgen Klopp may become similarly stubborn…


Must be so frustrating supporting Arsenal. Wenger says the squad doesn't need improving. £2k season tickets, Wenger has no ambition.
— Charlie Brady (@Charlie_B_LUFC) January 30, 2017



I really hope Klopp's stubbornness changes n he doesn't turn in to a Wenger-esque type. The squad is so weak n thin, yet no signings #LFC
— Scott Richardson (@scott5richo) January 28, 2017



Klopp needs to make sure he doesn't turn into Wenger with signings. Can't always go for the cheap deals

Arsenal – and indeed Liverpool – fans could be about to get even more frustrated over the next two days.
