HK USP 9MM in my arsenal 

					Picked up this old thing a few days ago. I bought it mainly because of its reputation for reliability. This is the V1 variant with decoker and safety.  I did some reading about the USP expert trigger .  They sell this trigger as a kit for the USP,  touting a better DA pull and a better reset.  I figured what the heck, I'll try one.  With some video help I was able to make the switch  to the target trigger.  Took it out today for a 100 rounds.  Worked perfectly and made the trigger much better in every way. I may just keep the old girl now.

					Nice find! I take it you found it used. May I ask what those older variants are going for nowadays?

					My first pistol ever that I owned was a USP SS in 9mm. I bought it at a pawn shop for 450.00 I am kicking myself for ever getting rid of it now...

					I have a USP Expert in .45, one of my coworkers has a regular USP in .45, the difference in the two triggers in night and day.  Definitely a great upgrade, nice pistol.

RE: HK USP 9MM in my arsenal 

					Nice choice,

My EDC for better than 13 years was a USPc V1 in .40, got sick of the .40 as a caliber and traded it for a SS Colt 1911. 

 Regret.

On the lookout for another HK in either 9 or 45.

RE: HK USP 9MM in my arsenal 

					Even though I own a USP with the LEM trigger in .40, I still do not like it.
The gun is too clunky and chunky and the trigger pull is hard and deep.
Not a fan of the bar for the mag release either. I can't use my thumb on it without breaking grip, so I leanrned to use my middle finger.

I am an AR elitist, and I do not suffer fools. You have been warned. If you don't like my advice, ignore it and press on.
