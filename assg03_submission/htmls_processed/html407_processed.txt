Arsenal News HQ brings you the latest Arsenal news, match analysis, transfer news, injury news, team news and rumours from trusted media outlets around the world.
Arsenal, Inter Milan and AC Milan are set to go head to head in the race to sign Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne, according to gunnersphere.com.
Insigne is being linked with a move away from Napoli and Arsenal are believed to be one of the three clubs interested in signing him.
The forward is stalling on signing a contract extension with Napoli and that has placed his future at the club in doubt.
Reports claim he is demanding a new deal worth around £83,000 a week but Napoli are only prepared to pay him at most £41,000 weekly which will represent an increase of £11,000 weekly to his current deal.



Insigne had a tough start to the season, he failed to score a goal in his first 12 league games and subsequently lost his place in the starting xi but he has since regained his place in the team, scoring six goals in his last nine games.
Napoli want to keep the forward but they would listen to offers for him if he keeps stalling on signing a new contract. His current deal doesn’t expire until 2019 but Napoli chief Aurelio De Laurentiis would feel this is his best chance of getting a huge fee for the forward.
However, i’m not so sure if Wenger is interested in Insigne. I think we are being linked with the forward again because of our attempt to sign him in the past and also because we are one of the few clubs that can offer him what he is demanding.
Insigne is a good forward, no doubt but doesn’t have enough quality that would improve our squad.
