Top source CONFIRM Morata on his way to Arsenal, Madrid ready to sell

According to reports in Spain, Real Madrid are prepared to sell Arsenal target Alvaro Morata at the end of the season.
The Spaniard was heavily linked with a move to the Emirates last summer but Madrid were not willing to sell and offered the young man a new long-term contract to end our hopes of signing him.
Just few months after the contract extension, Madrid President Fioretino Perez reportedly wants to get rid of the striker.
According to Spanish publication Diario Gol via the Express, Perez is not pleased with Morata’s attitude and is prepared to sanction the striker’s exit in the next summer transfer window.
The report claims Morata is unhappy with Zidane’s decision to continuously over look him for the out of form Benzema and the situation hasn’t gone down well with him.


Perez who is unhappy with the Spaniard’s reaction has now decided to sell the player if he receives a £51.5m bid in the next transfer window.
The report mentioned Arsenal as one of the two Premier League clubs expected to make a move for Morata with Chelsea being the other.
Arsenal are not desperately in need of a striker, so I don’t think Wenger is actually interested in Morata or any other striker.
Even if Wenger is looking to upgrade his strike force, Morata hasn’t proven that he is the world class striker that would improve our team. Also, the French tactician won’t want to spend in excess of £50m on a striker who isn’t certain to make the first team.
There is no way a Morata to Arsenal move will happen for the fee that the report has quoted. Not with Wenger in charge at the helm of affairs.
