Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has responded to speculation linking Serge Gnabry with a sensational return to the Emirates.

Gnabry has scored seven goals in 15 appearances for Werder Bremen following the 21-year-old’s £5million transfer move to the Weser-Stadion at the end of August.
The Germany winger only managed 18 first-team games for the Gunners from 2012 to 2016 but his barnstorming form in the Bundesliga has attracted interest from a number of top European clubs.
But it appears Wenger is not interested in re-signing Gnabry just yet, despite the youngster having a £6.8m release clause in his contract at Bremen.
