Arsenal open talks with German winger

According to various reports that broke on Friday morning, Arsenal has apparently opened talks to sign Borussia Dortmund winger, Marco Reus. Rumours are circling that suggest that Wenger would be willing to pay up to £51 million for the German international in the summer window.

Marco Reus has scored 94 club goals in his career.
Italian journalist Emanuele Giulianelli claims that the Gunners are willing to offer Reus a salary of £6.8m/year on a five-year contract. The 27-year old’s Dortmund contract runs out in 2019, meaning the German club are under no pressure or obligation to sell him.
Marco Reus has always been a player highly-rated by fans of European football. However, injuries have always prevented the 27-year old from showcasing his talent at international competitions. Reus has missed 13 days through injury this season; significantly less than his previous years. Although he has still only started four games for Dortmund this campaign, scoring one goal and providing three assists.
Arsène Wenger is said to be a long-time admirer of the German since his days at Borussia Mönchengladbach, who he tried to sign him from in 2011. Marco Reus is also an apparent admirer of Arsenal, with his footballing idol being former Gunners midfielder, Tomas Rosicky.
Marco Reus has 29 caps for Germany.
It’s said that Marco Reus would be signed to replace the departing Alexis Sánchez. This kind of rumour doesn’t bode well for the contract negotiations between the club and the aforementioned Chilean. Replacement talks are either fed to the press to let the player know they’re not irreplaceable, or they’re leaked to actually set up future transfers. Alexis Sánchez’s current deal expires next summer and time is starting to run out.
In terms of outgoings, the Daily Mirror are reporting that Mathieu Debuchy is trying to force a move this January. The Frenchman has fallen way down the pecking order at The Emirates, with even Brazilian centre-back Gabriel being played at right-back ahead of him. Despite currently being injured, Debuchy’s relationship with the boss is at an all-time low, the 31-year old claims the two are not even on speaking terms anymore.
When asked about Debuchy’s future on Thursday, Wenger responded with “I didn’t close the door because there’s a lot of competition on the right flank.” Another Arsenal right-back Carl Jenkinson is also on the verge of leaving. He’s set to join Sam Allardyce at Crystal Palace, however, it’s said that personal terms are still yet to be agreed.

The transfer window closes on Tuesday the 31st of January at 23:00 BST, so there’s still plenty of time for clubs to get deals over the line. There’s also plenty of time for transfer rumours to mess with the minds of the Arsenal faithful. However, this is the first window in a long time that the majority of Arsenal fans haven’t been clamouring for Wenger to splash the cash. For once, there are no gaping holes in the squad and key players are gradually returning to full fitness. As it stands only Santi Cazorla will be out for the foreseeable future.
Arsenal fans would you be happy with Marco Reus replacing Alexis Sánchez?
