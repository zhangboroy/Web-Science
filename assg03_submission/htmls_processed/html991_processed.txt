ArsenalAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain's dominant FA Cup display shows Arsenal fans he can be the next Santi CazorlaThe Ox has often been pushed to the fringes, but he flourished in the centre on Saturday Share CommentsByCharles Watts13:16, 29 JAN 2017Updated14:24, 29 JAN 2017ArsenalAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain ran the show from Arsenal from midfield (Photo by Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) Share CommentsGet Arsenal updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain took us back to 2012 with his scintillating performance during Arsenal’s 5-0 win at Southampton. Most have forgotten the excitement that followed Oxlade-Chamberlain’s central midfield display against Milan in the 3-0 Champions League victory five years ago - but this was a big reminder. There was a time in the months after that Milan game when all the talk was how the former Southampton man’s best position was in the heart of midfield.

Arsenal fans delighted with Welbeck and Lucas

 He said he liked to play there and Arsene Wenger even hinted that it was where he saw him log-term. But then that talk just vanished, it was never to be heard again - until now.

 Oxlade-Chamberlain was given another run out in central midfield at St Mary’s and produced a wonderful display against his former club. He was patient, he was disciplined and showed unbelievable quality when in possession during a superb 90 minute performance. The returning Danny Welbeck will deservedly grab the headlines for his brace, as will Theo Walcott for his hat-trick - but my overriding memories of this one-sided contest will be of Oxlade-Chamberlain.

 Arsenal were head and shoulders above their hosts. Within five minutes it was clear that the Gunners had far too much for Saints and it was just going to be about how many goals they would get. They were dominant - and Oxlade-Chamberlain was a huge reason for that.

Alexis Sanchez's miserable face in training proves that he is finished with Arsenal

 The ball he played for Welbeck’s second goal was as good a pass as you will see all season. And it wasn’t a one-off - he played two more long passes of equal quality during the game, unfortunately on both occasions Walcott’s touches were poor so he couldn’t take advantage.

 All night long Oxlade-Chamberlain dictated the play from the middle of the park, sitting alongside the impressive Ainsley Maitland-Niles while Jeff Reine-Adelaide was given licence to go and support the front three. The England man clearly revelled in the central areas and enjoyed being in the heart of the action rather than out on either wing.

Arsene Wenger on fearing for Welbeck's future, Walcott's hat-trick and watching from the stands

 He was only moved there to cover for the rested Aaron Ramsey and Francis Coquelin and it’s a fairly safe bet to suggest that he will find himself back on the bench on Tuesday night against Watford. But he gave his manager a timely reminder of his abilities with his showing at Southampton and he has to be another option for Wenger to consider when it comes to those central positions.
