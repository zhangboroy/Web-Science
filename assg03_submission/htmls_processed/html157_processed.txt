EntertainmentNews/August 6, 2016/hamzystar /No Comment/440 views  Arsenal finally confirm the signing of Kelechi Nwakali 

 
Arsenal have confirmed the signing of talented Nigeria youngster Kelechi Nwakali from the Diamond Football Academy.
 
The attacking midfielder, who is seen as one of his country’s brightest prospects, was hugely impressive for Nigeria in their success at the U17 World Cup.
 
As reported by the club’s official website, Arsenal have now completed the signing of Nwakali, who had been linked with the Gunners for several months.
 
A statement from Arsenal read: “We have completed the signing of 18-year-old attacking midfielder Kelechi Nwakali from the Diamond Football Academy in Nigeria.
 
“The Nigeria youth international captained his country to victory in the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Chile last year, where he won the Player of the Tournament award.”
 
Arsenal suggest that Nwakali, perhaps owing to work permit problems, will spend time out on loan this season as he seeks to gain valuable experience of first-team football.
 
“Kelechi, who joins us as a young professional, will look to gain experience with a loan move in the coming months,” continued yhe report.
 
“We would like to welcome him to the club.”
 
The 18-year-old has been training with the Arsenal development squad this week and is highly regarded by Gunners manager Arsene Wenger, who met the prospect at a first-team game last season.
 
Nwakali will be aiming to eventually follow in the footsteps of his compatriots Nwankwo Kanu and Alex Iwobi in featuring for the Arsenal first- team.
 
Iwobi, who previously represented England at youth level before switching his allegiance to Newcastle, was hugely impressive for Arsenal in the closing stages of last season and has been given the number 17 shirt for the new campaign.
 
Nwakali, it seems, will have to bide his time before being able to feature for Arsenal, but he is extremely talented and will look to impress out on temporary transfer.
