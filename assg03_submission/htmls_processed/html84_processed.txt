PAULO DYBALA had fuelled speculation Juventus boss Max Allegri is quitting the Italian kings for Arsenal by snubbing his boss’ handshake.
Growing reports in Italy claim the Serie A master is in advanced talks to take over from 67-year-old Gunners legend Arsene Wenger.

		Allegri has been heavily linked with a move to take over at Arsenal which could have annoyed the striker	

The 49-year-old has guided Juve to two league titles, two Coppa Italia trophies, an Italian Super Cup and has them on course to win another Scudetto at the end of this campaign.

Paulo Dybala won't shake Massimiliano Allegri's hand when subbed for Juventus

		Paulo Dybala rejected the handshake Juventus boss Max Allegris offered him	





			Premium Sports		

4



		The Juventus striker was hooked on 77 minutes with his side comfortably in the lead	





			Premium Sports

		Dybala could have been rested for the massive match with Inter Milan next Sunday	

And he is allegedly keen for a fresh challenge after an era of dominance with the Old Lady.
During last summer, when Allegri was supposedly a rival with Antonio Conte for the Chelsea job, it emerged that Allegri has been taking English lessons for some time and would be able to walk into a Premier League dressing room and work.
And the petulant actions of Dybala, with 13 minutes of the 2-0 win over Sassuolo left, have raised rumours that news of Allegri’s imminent exit is now common knowledge among his players.

The Turin side was two goals up inside 25 minutes, thanks to goals from Gonzalo Higuain and Sami Khedira, and cruising with the final few minutes remaining when Dybala was called to the touchline.
Allegri sent on Marko Pjaca to replace the Argentina international who it seemed was being sensibly preserved for the big clash with Inter Milan next week.
But Dybala was clearly raging over something and left his boss hanging as his outstretched hand was brutally ignored.
