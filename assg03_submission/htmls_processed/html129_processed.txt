Arsenal passed up the chance to sign Sadio Mane, according to the man who played a key role in the Liverpool forward’s early career.
Mane was a product of the Generation Foot academy in Senegal before joining Metz late in 2011.
But during his time in France, Mane struggled to make an impact.
President of the Generation Foot academy, Mady Toure, revealed to L’Equipe that he spoke with Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi about a potential transfer but was told that the player wasn’t good enough for the Gunners.

‘He replied that he was insufficient… like others,’ said Toure.
Mane was subsequently sold to Red Bull Salzburg and spent two seasons with the Austrian club before joining Southampton.
Two seasons were enough to convince Liverpool of Mane’s quality as Jurgen Klopp’s side spent £34 million to sign the 24-year-old last summer.
