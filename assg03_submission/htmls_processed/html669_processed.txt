What’s This?




The days of using the overly complicated Photoshop are over. It seems today there are tons of apps you can use to create social media images. Today, we’ll run you by some of our favorite apps to create social media images. Most of these are free, if not, they are inexpensive…and regardless of the price, their ease of use makes them totally worth the money.
Socialdraft’s Favorite Apps to Create Social Media Images
1) WordSwag (available on App Store & Google Play) $3.99
Skip the starbucks and buy this app. It will be the best four bucks you ever spent. Not only is it ridiculously easy to use, you can either use your own images or choose one from their extensive library. There are tons of fonts and styles to use AND you can upload watermarks to your images.
2) Kanvas (available on App Store & Google Play) Free
Kanvas lets you create tons of different types of content: quotes, GIF bursts, videos, flipbooks, and tons more. It’s a free app/network, it’s super easy to use and you can’t beat the price.
3) Ripl (Available on App Store) Freemium ($9.99)
Sometimes you want to make something more than just a static image. Ripl allows you to make quote images like WordSwag, but allows you to animate them. The paid version gets you a watermark free product.
4) TweetRoot (Available on App Store) Free
This one lets you create tag clouds incredibly fast. Catch is you need to connect your Twitter account since it pulls hashtags from Twitter accounts.
5) Skitch (Availale on App Store) Free
Skitch is awesome not for those super polished images, but for those images that are more raw. Imagine you want to craft a sort of tutorial and you need to mark up an image, add text, arrows, and more. This is the app you want.
6) Canva (Available on App Store) Free
You can use Canva’s drag-and-drop feature and layouts to easily design graphics. Canva provides premade templates, fonts, and more.
7) PowerPoint

With PowerPoint you can create customized images with design options in two easy steps. Add an image and pick your favorite. You can set photos as slide backgrounds, add text, colors, icons and graphics. Just save the slide in PowerPoint as an image.
8) Social Image Resizer (Free – desktop only)
Twitter, Facebook and other platforms require different image sizes and aspect ratios. With this tool you can resize, crop or change the file format type from the source image. Upload your image, then choose from a drop-down list of options.
9) Recite
With Recite you can take quotes and create images from them. Just enter your quote into the editor on the homepage, and choose a layout from the long list of templates.
10) Easel.ly (Available on App Store) Free
With a tool like Easel.ly you can embed charts and photos on a prebuilt template or a template of your own design. Easel.ly comes with icons, shapes, and objects that you can drag-and-drop into your editor.
11) PhotoGrid (Available on App Store & Google Play) Free
With Photo Grid you can create collages using your own photos. Once you download the app, for both iPhone and Android, you can set up an account or just use the tools to create your collages.
12) Smilebox (Available on App Store) $0.99
With a program such as Smilebox, you can create a slideshow with a collection of photos and add music from their music library or yours, for a soundtrack that captures the spirit of your moments. Visit their Slideshows Gallery to see what other Smilebox fans are creating.
