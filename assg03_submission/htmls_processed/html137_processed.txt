'I CAN LET IT GO'
Paulo Dybala snubbed Max Allegri handshake – but Juventus boss is not worried about reaction of star man as Arsenal rumours swirl

Italian manager continues to be linked with Arsenal job but insists he is only thinking of Juve

30th January 2017, 11:01 am



 







JUVENTUS manager Max Allegri has revealed why Paulo Dybala snubbed his handshake after being substituted – saying his anger is a “good thing”.
The incident during Juve’s 2-0 win over Sassuolo sparked even more speculation that the Italian boss is set to move to Arsenal.
Paulo Dybala won't shake Massimiliano Allegri's hand when subbed for Juventus

		Paulo Dybala pulled his hand away rather than shake the hand of Juventus manager Max Allegri	

The Argentinian star was taken off with 13 minutes to go in the win, but Allegri says he only took Dybala off as Juan Cuadrado and Mario Mandzukic appeared less tired.
He told Italian media after the game: "Dybala was angry which is a good thing.
"Every player would would like to stay on the pitch.
"He played well, but Cuadrado and Mandzukic still had more energy, so I took him off.
"It can happen that he gets angry at the manager in the moment."

		Allegri says the reaction was a 'good thing' as players shouldn't want to go off	

Allegri then joked: "Dybala didn't give me his hand so you guys had something to talk about this week."
But the 49-year-old then took a more serious tone with his next statement.
He added: "It is possible that he was angry about the substitution.
"The main thing is to acknowledge the team-mate who is replacing you, who deserves to be respected.
"Then, if he doesn't acknowledge me, I can always let it go, if the effort was good and Dybala keeps on playing like that."

		Dybala starred as Juventus stayed top of Serie A with a 2-0 win over Sassuolo	

Allegri was then asked about his future at Juventus.
He said: "I still have a year-and-a-half left on my contract with Juve. We are in tune and there are no problems.
"We are at the top [of the Serie A table], in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and in the knockout stages of the Champions League.
"This is my third season here and I could go on and on [at the club], but this depends on me and the club.
"I do not think about the future, but only about the season between now and May 28."
