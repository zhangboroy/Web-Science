Antonio Conte’s side hold an eight-point advantage over their closest challengers Arsenal, having won an astonishing 15 of their last 16 Premier League matches.

‘We wanted to win more games after the Tottenham result, and before we play Liverpool and Arsenal,’ he told Chelsea’s official website.
‘Now we have a big gap, hopefully we can win against them and put ourselves further away.’
