Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal have enough squad depth to play a 3-4-3 system in the same style as Chelsea.
In addition to his first-choice pairing of Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi, the Arsenal manager has a wealth of options in central defence with Gabriel, Rob Holding and Per Mertesacker, who returned to full training last week.

A defeat to Arsenal at the end of September sparked Antonio Conte’s decision to switch to a 3-4-3 system at Chelsea, while Mauricio Pochettino has also adopted a similar formation at Tottenham.
And Wenger believes Arsenal would also be capable of replicating their rivals if required.

‘We can play with three at the back, yes,’ said the Arsenal boss.
‘We have Gabriel, we have Mertesacker, we have Holding, we have of course Koscielny and Mustafi. When needed we can do that.
‘But we are a team who are focused on an offensive game. Overall, we like always to go forward and have numbers in the middle of the park and up front.’
