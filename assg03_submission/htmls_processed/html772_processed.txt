INTER WANT CROCKED VIDAL

Despite Aleix Vidal looking like he will miss the rest of Barcelona's season, Inter are preparing a summer move for the injured player, according to a report from GazzaMercato.

LEICESTER FIND THEIR NEXT VARDY

Leicester City have taken non-league striker Joshua Gordon on trial as they search for the next Jamie Vardy, ESPN reports.

MAN CITY TARGET MENDY

Manchester City are keeping an eye on Benjamin Mendy as they look to sign a new left-back, ESPN reports.
The Premier League club are in the market for a new defender and are said to have sent scouts to watch the 22-year-old. Mendy, a first-team regular at Monaco, will have the chance to impress Pep Guardiola in next week's Champions League last-16 encounter. 
BAYERN TO SWOOP FOR DEMBELE

Bayern Munich are prepared to make a £30 million offer for Celtic star Moussa Dembele during the close season, The Daily Record claims. 
The 20-year-old attacker has been in excellent form for the Glasgow side since joining from Fulham at the start of the season. With 27 goals in 41 games for Brendan Rodgers' side, Dembele has attracted interest from the Premier League, but the Bundesliga champions are preparing a big bid to try to bring him to Bavaria.
MAN CITY PLOT £100m MESSI BID

REDS OPEN GOTZE TALKS

The World Cup winner has previously worked with Jurgen Klopp in Germany and will cost around £20 million, with Dortmund paying that to re-sign him from Bayern Munich.
DONNARUMMA TO LAND NEW DEAL

AC Milan are prepared to offer in-demand goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma a bumper pay raise in an effort to fend off interest in his services, reports Calciomercato.
Chelsea and Juventus are among those to have been linked with the talented teenager, but Milan intend to table a five-year deal worth €2 million-a-year to keep a prized asset at the San Siro.
BARCA SEEK VIDAL REPLACEMENT

Barcelona have lined up three possible replacements for the injured Aleix Vidal, according to a report in AS.
Right-back Vidal's season has been ended by an ankle injury and the Catalans are said to have identified Deportivo La Coruna's Juanfran, Malaga's Roberto Rosales and Valencia star Joao Cancelo has potential solutions.
ROONEY COULD LEAVE THIS MONTH

Wayne Rooney could leave Manchester United before the close of the Chinese transfer window at the end of February, according to the Daily Telegraph.

SOLANKE TO LIVERPOOL?

Dominic Solanke could leave Chelsea to join Premier League rivals Liverpool at the end of the season as the Blues refuse to pay his £50,000-a-week wages, according to The Sun. 
The 19-year-old's current contract expires this summer and he is keen to leave for Anfield in a deal worth around £8 million in place of a switch to Celtic.
BAYERN JOIN BELOTTI RACE
