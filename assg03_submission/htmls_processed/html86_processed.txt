Atletico Madrid are prepared to give Alexis Sanchez a contract worth £220,000 a week in order to leave Arsenal, according to reports.
The Sun claim that Diego Simeone’s side are preparing for Antoine Griezmann’s sale this summer and view the Chile international as the ideal replacement.
Atletico are anticipating that they will receive around £86 million for Griezmann and will offer £35m for Sanchez, and are prepared to pay the forward’s contract demands.
Atletico are also confident that they can lure the 28-year-old back to La Liga, just three years after he left Barcelona for Arsenal.

Arsenal have already offered Sanchez a contract worth £160,000 a week but the Chilean is yet to sign fresh terms.
It’s also claimed that Arsene Wenger’s future will have no bearing on Sanchez’s decision, with the Arsenal boss’ current deal expiring at the end of the season.
