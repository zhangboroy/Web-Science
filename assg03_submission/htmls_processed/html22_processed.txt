SportThe Arsenal XI that Arsene Wenger COULD have signed - featuring Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel MessiArsene Wenger has revealed he could have signed N'Golo Kante - but the Chelsea ace is just one of many stars who ALMOST joined The Gunners Share CommentsByRichard Innes11:24, 3 FEB 2017Updated13:29, 3 FEB 2017SportYes, Arsenal fans, it's a dream. But it very nearly could have been. Honest.

Arsene Wenger had admitted that he looked into signing Leicester City's Premier League title winner N'Golo Kante last summer, only to be beaten to him by Chelsea. Kante has gone on to be one of the players of this Premier League season, and a vital cog in Chelsea's engine room.

 And speaking ahead of his side's trip to Stamford Bridge this weekend, the Arsenal boss confirmed that he has twice tried to sign his fellow countryman. “Yes," said Wenger. "When he was in France, when he was at Leicester. Then again, I cannot explain everything but it's quite obvious when you look where he’s gone.

 So, Arsenal could have had one of the Premier League's finest players on their books - but the boss missed out on him. And if you think that might get that might outrage the Wenger Out Brigade, just wait until they see the below. An entire team of superstars who oh-so-NEARLY signed for the red half of North London… but didn't.

 The Italian legend was linked with a move to north London after declaring his desire to join the club if Juventus were to show him the door. A deal never materialised and the Gooners were stuck with Manuel Almunia. Gerard Pique

 It's reported the Barcelona defender was a failed work-permit away from joining the Gooners with fellow Spaniard Cesc Fabregas. Arsenal signed young defender Philippe Senderos instead. Smart. Vincent Kompany

 The two-time Premier League winner was almost signed by Arsenal as a youngster from boyhood club Anderlecht. Wenger was keen to find a long-term replacement for Sol Campbell but wasn't keen on the £5million transfer fee. FYI, Johan Djourou made 30 appearances that season. Roberto Carlos

 The Brazilian legend revealed that joining the Gooners would be a 'dream', claiming that he wanted a move to the Emirates once his contract at Real Madrid had expired - he signed for Turkish side Fenerbahçe instead. Fortunately, the Arsenal faithful were later treated to the man dubbed the 'new Roberto Carlos'. You remember Andre Santos, right?

 The story goes a young Ronaldo was shown around London Colney and given an Arsenal jersey with his name on the back. A £4million deal with Sporting Lisbon was agreed, only for Sporting to host Manchester United in a friendly. Ronaldo tore the United defence apart, Sir Alex Ferguson was impressed… and Arsenal never got their man. Yaya Toure

 He was on the club's radar from a early age only to be declined a work-permit in 2003. Despite featuring in a friendly against Barnet, securing a permit proved tricky work for Arsenal and Wenger's patience eventually ran out. As it has done many times against Man City in recent years.

 With Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez hoping to lure Gareth Barry to Merseyside, Alonso feared his Liverpool career was over, Alonso headed to London hoping to secure a £15million transfer. The Barry move apparently fell through… and Mikel Arteta went to Arsenal. Angel Di Maria

 Arsenal fans knew their club could never have matched the £59.7m Man United spent on the Argentinian midfielder. Still, even The Gunners could have scraped together the price of the plane ticket that would have been needed to bring him to north London when he was 17. Pesky work permits, eh? Lionel Messi

 According to Spanish football expert Guillem Balague, Gunners scouts not only identified the 15 year-old Argentine alongside Barca rising stars Fabregas and Pique - they even offered him a contract. Needless to say, it didn't pan out. Stop laughing, Spurs fans. Zlatan Ibrahimovic

 Zlatan was on the verge of a £3million move from Malmo, back when he was 19. All was going to plan until Wenger asked him to play in a trial match. The Swede replied with: "Zlatan doesn't do auditions.'' Arsenal signed current West Ham full-back Guy Demel instead - back in the days when he thought he was a striker. Didier Drogba

 Wenger claims that he could have signed the Ivorian for as little as £100,000 way back his Le Mans days. After watching the Chelsea hero on numerous occasions, the Arsenal manager didn't feel Drogba was ready for a club of Arsenal's stature. So that worked out well... Now let's check out how Mr Wenger is feeling after reading this piece:  Oh dear. Sorry, Arsene. Did you know we have an Arsenal Facebook page?
