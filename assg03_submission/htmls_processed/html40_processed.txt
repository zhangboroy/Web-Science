I'll give you the rundown of my problems so far.~~The in-game player character has...1: Spun in complete 360 turns for no reason.2: Walked backward when I'm trying to go forward.3: Tried to shoot his gun but stops and retries and stops and so on about 9 times within a few seconds.4: Not move at all no matter what I push. Try not moving at all in a fast-paced survival game.~~The controller has...1: Extremely "tight" R3 and L3 buttons that require significant pressure to use.(This makes running almost impossible, especially in time critical survival games)2: Cheap craftsmanship. It creaks and squeaks like it's going to break any time.(Which makes pressure sensitive button moments uncomfortable)3: Sometimes unresponsive buttons, which makes ANY game frustrating.I thought I was getting a good deal because the price for these (at the time I purchased them) was almost $12 which compared to the $50 price tag for Sony brand, makes these a steal. Or makes them look like a steal. The controllers have a "5 year warranty" so let's see what gets done by the manufacturer.Read more0Comment|

      Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsWondering why it's so cheap? So was I..ByJonathan K.on December 4, 2013Color: BlackI thought I found a great deal on a ps3 controller. Boy was I wrong. First, out of the games I've played, over half REQUIRE a (six-axis) motion sensor in the controller to play through certain areas of the game. This controller does not have that. If you happen upon one of these games, you will no longer be able to progress. Makes virtually half of the ps3 library games unplayable. Second, the joystick (mainly the right one) is extremely hard to use in fast paced shooters. Small movements of the joystick are nearly impossible. Many times I've been circling the enemy with my crosshairs because it's so hard to use precise movements. Bottom line, DO NOT waste your time thinking you found a cheap alternative. The games you will start and never get to finish simply aren't worth it.Read more0Comment|

0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsDelivered item doesn't match image or descriptionByAmazon Customeron February 17, 2017Color: Black|Verified PurchaseThe image posted on the page is NOT the item that was delivered.  This item is advertised, in print and product image, as a Playstation 3 model controller, when what was delivered is actually the XBOX Controller-S style.  Presumably, it still functions on the PS3, but they are two very different controllers.  Also, there is no return shipping label, so I can't send it back.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsYou get what you paid forByChris Osburnon February 20, 2014Color: BlackIf all you want is a controller, then this is a good deal, however, I have numerous complaints.First off, the joystick sensitivity is horrible. Making small, precise movements is nearly impossible.The buttons are a bit clunky to press down, more notably, the shoulder buttons.The lack of SIXAXIS renders many features in many games useless.Vibrations on the controller seem to randomly 'press' other buttons, making many games difficult to play.However, if you can get past all of these flaws, its a nice and cheap controller to make due til' you buy a better one.Read more11 comment|
