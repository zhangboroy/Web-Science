              Late winner: Mahmoud Kahraba wheels away after snatching victory AFP/Getty Images 




Egypt's Mahmoud Kahraba scored three minutes from time to snatch a 1-0 win over Morocco on Sunday and book a place in the African Cup of Nations semi-finals.
The seven-times winners were on the back foot for much of the quarter-final against their north African rivals but grabbed the winner from an 87th-minute corner.
Morocco failed to clear the bouncing ball and substitute Kahraba hooked it home from close range to set up a last-four meeting with Burkina Faso on Wednesday.
Aziz Bouhaddouz had twice gone close for Morocco before the winner, while Romain Saiss and midfielder Mbark Boussoufa hit the woodwork as Egypt rode their lack before completing a smash-and-grab victory. 
Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny was absent from the squad with a calf problem, but the severity of the problem is unclear and it is not known whether he will be fit to feature in Egypts's semi. 
Ghana meet Cameroon in the other semi-final in Franceville on Thursday.
