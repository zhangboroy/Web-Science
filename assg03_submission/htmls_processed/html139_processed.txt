Expect there to be some talk of Dat Guy…

Will he do it against Watford?

So in case you’re wondering why we haven’t heard from the Big Bossman yet, it’s because he is always late.






smorgan
30th January 20179:14 am


Sorry, by Big Bossman, I do of course mean Mr Arsene Wenger.






smorgan

On Welbeck: “He is very sharp. Physically he is ready. But we must manage the time we play him.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:19 am


On the transfer window: “Very quiet. On our front we have a big squad. We are not in the need to buy.
“On the general front it is very quiet. All the teams in England, especially the big teams, have big teams.
“There is no news about Carl Jenkinson. Still open to move but it doesn’t look like something will happen.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:20 am


On the four-match ban: “I don’t think there is anything to add on that.
“I have spoken a lot about that. I didn’t appeal so I accept the sanction and get on with it.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:21 am


Back to Dat Guy welbz: “I’m pleased with performances individually.
“We had many players scoring goals but Danny was not there. Now we have huge offensive potentials.
“I have to use strikers well now without destroying balance of team.
“Perez has also contributed well. Offensively we have many players who can produce and score.”

Thoughts on @DannyWelbeck, boss?
🗣 “He is very sharp but we still have to be cautious with him. We still have to manage him well”#AFCvWFC pic.twitter.com/JezcEuEBaw

smorgan
30th January 20179:22 am


On the transfer window: “You have to have a need, not just buy players.
“We have what we need to do well. We have to produce the performances now in every game.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:23 am


Welbz: “Of course he has done enough to keep his place but we have to be cautious.
“We can’t use him every three days I think he is a bit short on that but the quality is there.
“His return – and the quality of all our strikers – offensively we have a strong squad.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:24 am


Have Watford improved: “I don’t know. We’ll see tomorrow night.
“We have created a run and it’s important we retain that.
“Our attitude is spot on and we are ready to fight tomorrow.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:24 am


Arsenal well-equipped to play three at the back? “Yes we can, when needed we can do that.
“But we are focused on the offensive and we like to go forward and have numbers middle of park and up front.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:25 am


Link to Benzema – why? “Because he’s French. There are some noises he would leave Madrid.
“In the summer window? That’s not my worry at the moment. What’s my worry is the next game against Watford.”





smorgan
30th January 20179:26 am


Wenger confirms Carl Jenkinson would leave on a permanent deal, if he goes.
Wenger said: “There is no problem with his attitude. He must find happiness with conditions and where he goes.”
No offers for Debuchy – still possible he could go. Wenger confirms he is fit and back in training.





smorgan
30th January 20179:30 am


And that is that from Mr Wenger.
There we go, then. It would appear things are going to be taken gently regarding Danny Welbeck’s full-time return to the squad.
Meanwhile it should be a quiet transfer day for Arsenal tomorrow – but there could be fireworks in the summer with a possible move for Karim Benzema.
There are no firm offers for Carl Jenkinson yet but any deal will be permanent.
