AP"I'm very disappointed, frustrated and humiliated," the Croatian told reporters after a defeat which left his side one point above the bottom three.Showing only brief flashes of last year's form when they challenged for a top-four spot, West Ham were only trailing to a Mesut Ozil goal after 72 minutes despite being outplayed before Alexis Sanchez finished them off with a sublime treble.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said West Ham's lack of confidence had been clear - a state of mind not helped by playing in a cavernous London Stadium that generates little of the atmosphere that West Ham's Upton Park ground provided.Bilic, however, was not looking for excuses and said a lack of confidence was only partly to blame for his side winning just three of their opening 14 games."Arsene is very polite. Of course, he knows," Bilic said."Confidence is a chain reaction. We are responsible. Somewhere between the end of last season and pre-season we lost the intensity. We don't have it at every training session, we have it occasionally and that's why we can't do it for 90 minutes in the games."We have to bring that back. Without that you can't rely only on quality. It doesn't matter about the quality you have if you don't have the intensity at the level that is required."The intensity and dedication to the cause is missing."With a trip to Liverpool next week followed by consecutive home games against fellow strugglers Burnley and Hull City, the next few weeks will be crucial for West Ham and Bilic accepts that he is under pressure."I feel under pressure, I put the pressure on myself," he said. "I am not happy with the display. I don't want to feel like this. So, of course, I am feeling pressure."We are in a relegation fight. Of course we are. The players know that. But I'm very optimistic, I never give up and I'm positive that I can turn this around."#Alexis sanchez#Arsenal#Arsène wenger#Football#Kickingaround#Premier league#Slaven bilić#West hamAlso SeeArsenal have become a self-parody and desperately need change, is it time for Arsene Wenger to go?Champions League preview: Arsenal under pressure to end 'curse' against Bayern MunichPremier League: Arsenal ride on Alexis Sanchez's brace to see off gutsy Hull CityPremier League: Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain backtracks after #WengerOut Twitter gaffeTop StoriesKairana: How this UP town's glorious musical past faded into its troubled presentCrippling Bandh Forces Out Nagaland CM Zeliang; Successor TomorrowNagaland CM TR Zeliang steps down; MLAs meet on Monday, Neiphiu Rio likely to take overKoffee With Karan season 5: Kangana 'schools' Karan; Saif gets in a few zingersCommon medical insurance mistakes & steps to correct themAltamas Kabir passes away: All you need to know about the former Chief Justice of IndiaLal Shahbaz Qalandar bombing: Will Pakistan's Urdu media come out of the denial narrative?IPL 2017 auction: From Prithvi Shaw to Tymal Mills, five players who might punch above their weightCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingSri Lanka in Australia, 3 T20 International Series, 2017Sri Lanka beat Australia by 2 wicketsAfghanistan in Zimbabwe, 5 ODI Series, 2017Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe by 54 runsSouth Africa in New Zealand, 5 ODI Series, 2017South Africa beat New Zealand by 4 wicketsSri Lanka in Australia, 3 T20 International Series, 2017Sri Lanka beat Australia by 5 wicketsSouth Africa in New Zealand, Only T20 International Series, 2017South Africa beat New Zealand by 78 runsAfghanistan in Zimbabwe, 5 ODI Series, 2017Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe by 12 runs (D/L method)Sri Lanka in South Africa, 5 ODI Series, 2017South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 88 runsBangladesh in India, Only Test, 2017India beat Bangladesh by 208 runsSri Lanka in South Africa, 5 ODI Series, 2017South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 40 runsChappell-Hadlee Trophy, 2017New Zealand beat Australia by 24 runsAfghanistan in Zimbabwe, 5 ODI Series, 2017ZIM vs AFG - Feb 21st, 2017, 01:00 PM ISTSouth Africa in New Zealand, 5 ODI Series, 2017NZ vs SA - Feb 22nd, 2017, 03:30 AM ISTSri Lanka in Australia, 3 T20 International Series, 2017AUS vs SL - Feb 22nd, 2017, 02:20 PM ISTAustralia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017IND vs AUS - Feb 23rd, 2017, 09:30 AM ISTAfghanistan in Zimbabwe, 5 ODI Series, 2017ZIM vs AFG - Feb 24th, 2017, 01:00 PM ISTSouth Africa in New Zealand, 5 ODI Series, 2017NZ vs SA - Feb 25th, 2017, 06:30 AM ISTAfghanistan in Zimbabwe, 5 ODI Series, 2017ZIM vs AFG - Feb 26th, 2017, 01:00 PM ISTSouth Africa in New Zealand, 5 ODI Series, 2017NZ vs SA - Mar 1st, 2017, 06:30 AM ISTIreland in United Arab Emirates, 2 ODI Series, 2017UAE vs IRE - Mar 2nd, 2017, 12:30 PM ISTEngland in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017WI vs ENG - Mar 3rd, 2017, 07:00 PM IST Site Index
