And according to the Mail on Sunday's Rob Draper, the Gunners are now also willing to smash their transfer record to land the France international.According to Draper, Griezmann's contract has a buyout clause of £85 million, while Archer claims the clause is roughly £95 million.David Ramos/Getty ImagesDraper also insists manager Arsene Wenger would be willing to hand the 25-year-old more than £250,000 per week in wages. But the Gunners won't go as high as United, who remain the favourites to land Griezmann.Sports writer Ben Fairthorne doubts Arsenal will compete financially with the Red Devils:Ben Fairthorne @BFairthorneWith the wages Griezmann is set to demand it's extremely unlikely Arsenal will be in the race. Chelsea will be, but United strong favourites1/29/2017, 12:22:28 PMIt's important to note Griezmann's clause is a buyout clause, not a release clause. The former is standard for all La Liga players and susceptible to taxation when triggered―so the eventual transfer fee could be much higher than the clause.Normally, clubs would try to come to an agreement with Atletico and spend a fee close to the clause. But Los Rojiblancos still have a transfer ban to deal with and won't be too keen on losing their top forward, knowing they can't replace him.Griezmann has established himself as one of the most wanted forwards in the world in the past few seasons, finishing third in the most recent Ballon d'Or voting. Here's a look at some of his highlights:His ability to move incisively and high football IQ would make him a perfect fit for Wenger's team, and he could be the type of talent Arsenal need to finally win another Premier League title.The finances don't seem to add up, however. The Gunners still haven't been able to come to an agreement with the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil as far as wages go. And United and Chelsea will likely blow their offer out of the water.Signing Griezmann would be a phenomenal move for the Gunners, but as of right now, it doesn't seem likely.Dino Panato/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Corriere dello Sport (h/t Metro's Coral Barry) reports Roma have agreed to a deal to sign midfield starlet Kessie, who was wanted by a host of Premier League clubs, including Arsenal.Per the report, the Giallorossi will pay Atalanta £20 million and send two youth prospects to Bergamo. In return, Kessie will move to the Italian capital in the summer.Frequently compared to compatriot Yaya Toure, the Ivory Coast international has been the breakout star of the season in Italy so far, playing a key role in Atalanta's unexpected rise.Here are some of his highlights:The 20-year-old stands out for his vision, passing range, remarkable physical strength and ability to score. He only made the switch to a midfield role last year, and his quick rise at the position bodes well for the future.All isn't lost for his Premier League suitors, as Calciomercato.com's Edo Dalmonte believes Kessie prefers a move to England over a Roma switch.Like the new article format?
