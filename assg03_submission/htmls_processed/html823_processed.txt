Wenger was sent-off during last weekend’s dramatic late win over Burnley and was handed a four-game touchline ban for pushing fourth official Anthony Talyor.

Asked before the win which booked Arsenal’s place in the fifth round of the FA Cup how the ban might affect Arsenal in Wenger’s absence, Keown revealed why you rarely, if ever, see any of his backroom staff on their feet.
‘Not really – you could say that it won’t make much difference,’ Keown told BT Sport.
‘Arsene Wenger prepares very well in a very calm fashion and there’s never too much shouting.
