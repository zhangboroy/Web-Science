Rumours rated: Kolasinac to Chelsea? Morata to Arsenal? Giovinco to China?



Gab Marcotti assesses some rumoured moves around football, including the possibility of Alvaro Morata joining Arsenal. 

ESPN FC's Gab Marcotti has his finger on the pulse of all the latest transfer news ahead of Tuesday's deadline. 

English football has seen some huge transfers completed on deadline day in years gone by. Will we see anymore this January? 
With the January transfer window set to close, where might the late deals be done? David Amoyal looks at some of the current rumours and predicts how likely it is that the proposed moves actually happen.
Alvaro Morata to Arsenal: 35 percent
The Spanish striker has been linked with a move but, considering Real Madrid were asking in excess of €50 million for him last summer, his market is likely to be restricted to the Premier League now that Paris Saint-Germain has signed Goncalo Guedes. Arsenal has been linked to Morata before and his age -- 24 -- and proven track record make him an appealing option. Antonio Conte, who managed Morata at Juventus, could also try to bring him to Chelsea.
Sead Kolasinac to Chelsea next summer: 60 percent
While Juventus had identified the Bosnian left-back as the ideal long-term replacement for Patrice Evra, recent convincing performances by Kwadwo Asamoah have made him less of a pressing need. Chelsea are now the leaders in the race but, despite their relationship with Schalke, to whom they loaned Baba Rahman recently, they likely will have to wait to sign Kolasinac on a free transfer ahead of next season, rather than acquiring him in January.
Branislav Ivanovic to Zenit: 55 percent
The 32-year-old defender's contract expires at end of the season and he hasn't started a Premier League game since September; Chelsea have enough depth on defense after Nathan Ake's return from Bournemouth. Zenit is looking to acquire him before the window closes and is also offering a long-term deal, a factor that increases its chances over the Premier League clubs monitoring the situation. Ivanovic previously played in Russia at Lokomotiv Moscow.
Luiz Gustavo to Juventus: 25 percent
With Kwadwo Asamoah moved to left-back, the Serie A champions continue to look for ways to bolster in midfield. The top choice is Lyon's Corentin Tolisso, but landing him in January is unlikely, especially considering that he's cup tied in the Champions League. As a stop gap, Juve are trying to sign Wolfsburg's Luiz Gustavo on loan with an option to buy. However, the German club is unlikely to accept that type of deal.
Manolo Gabbiadini to Southampton: 50 percent


Manolo Gabbiadini has scored three times in Serie A this season.
Napoli has a reputation as being a tough negotiator and continues to hold out for better terms from Southampton who, so far, has offered €16 million, plus 4 million in bonuses and a percentage of any future sale. As a last-ditch effort to get a deal done, the Saints are willing make the bonus more easily attainable and that maybe enough to convince Napoli to let Gabbiadini leave, especially since the player is pushing for the move.
Asmir Begovic to Bournemouth: 35 percent
The goalkeeper is looking to play regularly and Antonio Conte is willing to grant his wish, if he can find a suitable replacement. Chelsea kicked the tires on Fernando Muslera but he is content at Galatasaray. The most realistic option is Craig Gordon and Chelsea have made a second offer, but Celtic is willing to offer him a new contract. As such, Begovic may have to wait until the summer to find a new team.
Sebastian Giovinco to China: 15 percent
The Italian striker and his agent Andre D'Amico have publically confirmed the interest of at least two Chinese clubs, but getting the "Atomic Ant" to leave Canada won't be easy. While Giovinco admitted the financial aspect was a key factor in his decision to move to MLS and he could earn substantially more in China, when he left Italy he had a limited role and he has adapted very well to living in North America.
Leandro Paredes to Premier League: 40 percent
The Argentine midfielder has struggled to replace Miralem Pjanic and Roma could cash in to address their Financial Fair Play issues. According to Gianluca Di Marzio, the Italian club is willing to move the 22-year-old for around €25 million. Liverpool scouted him multiple times at Empoli, while Arsenal is intrigued by his potential. Juventus is also interested but, since he doesn't have an exit clause, it's more likely Roma would try to sell him abroad. 
Franck Kessie to Roma: 25 percent
The 20-year-old Ivorian midfielder has been one of the most sought-after this month, having been linked to many of the Premier League's top clubs, as well as PSG. Roma is the most recent contender in the race for Kessie, but any deal there would have to be a loan with option to buy, to spread payments into the 2018 fiscal year. Roma hopes Kessie follows Paulo Dybala's path by choosing to stay in Serie Ato develop, rather than going abroad.
Andrea Pinamonti to Liverpool: 15 percent
The striker, born in 1999, has been scouted by Liverpool as well as Juventus during his games with Inter's top youth team and will be eligible to sign his first professional contract next June when he turns 18. While Pinamonti has numerous suitors, Inter is determined to sign him and have him join its senior squad next season.
