Sanchez’s contract is set to expire in 2018, while Reus’ deal at Dortmund still has two-and-a-half years left to run on it. The German giants are under no pressure to cash in soon, but it appears a big offer in excess of £50m is being lined up by the Gunners.Any move for Reus would not be likely until the summer, and Arsenal remain very keen despite his injury record.
