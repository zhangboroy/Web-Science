Emirates Rewards Lucky Ugandan Arsenal Fans. 
  

Emirates, a global connector of people and places, and voted the World’s Best Airline 2016 at the Skytrax World Airline Awards, has rewarded eight lucky Ugandans with personalized Arsenal football jerseys.
The winners participated in an eight-week radio competition in which they answered questions relating to Emirates’ products, services and destinations.
Emirates is a major sponsor of Arsenal Football Club and made available some of their jerseys as prizes, with Kayiira Matthew, Kivumbi Jimmy, Lutaya Ramanzan, Munina Chris and Sebinene Jimmy, being amongst the winners.

The personalized jerseys were handed over to the winners by the newly appointed Emirates Country Manager to Uganda, Mr. Mohammad Al Attar. Speaking at the handover, he said; “Through our sponsorships of many teams and major events around the world, we aim connect to our customers through their passion for sports. There are many Arsenal fans in Uganda, and this competition is another way in which we can share in their passion for football.”

Emirates has been committed to sports sponsorship in both the UAE and around the world for over twenty years, beginning with the first powerboat race held in Dubai, in 1987. Additionally, Emirates sponsors various sports events and teams such as; Football, Rugby, Tennis, Golf, Motorsport, Cricket and Horse Racing, amongst others.
EK 729 departs Dubai International Airport every day at 0925hrs and arrives at the Entebbe International Airport at 1350hrs. The return flight, EK730, leaves Entebbe at 1520hrs and lands in Dubai at 2135hrs.
