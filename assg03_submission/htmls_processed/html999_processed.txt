					Finally, another long Arsenal transfer saga reaches it's conclusion. I'm so pleased he's joined us, if he can perform half as well as Coquelin we'll have a player on our hands. Flamteta should be released with immediate effect. 

Welcome Elneny, been on a personal scouting mission since we were seriously linked to him. He looks a real talent, I mentioned in his transfer thread his style reminds me of Blaise Matuidi, a player I'm a huge fan of.

Called it. Apparently, I got through to Thomas who described himself as the male Boobzilla.

					Think we are all Aswan in sending out our best wishes and a big "Welcome to Arsenal" to Elneny.

I don't know much about the Giza but it can't just be me who sphinx he'll fit into our midfield pyramid just great.

If you don't agree, you're simply in denial.
