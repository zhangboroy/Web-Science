The former Southampton player was compared to more than one legendary midfielder as he put in an excellent performance in the middle of the park








EXTRA TIME

Arsenal fans were left in awe on Saturday not just by the team's 5-0 trouncing of Southampton in the FA Cup, but also the performance of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
The player nicknamed 'The Ox' was deployed in central midfield as Steve Bould stepped in for the suspended Arsene Wenger, and had an excellent game for the Gunners.
Arsenal fans showed their appreciation on Twitter, with some comparing the 23-year-old England international to midfield legends Andrea Pirlo and Xavi.



The Ox is playing like a prime Andrea Pirlo tonight.
— Ö (@OliPriceBates) January 28, 2017


No idea why some Arsenal fans don't rate the Ox.
— GeoffArsenal (@GeoffArsenal) January 28, 2017


Always thought it was his best position. Trouble is he won't get in the side there
— Lee Dixon (@LeeDixon2) January 28, 2017


Big shoutout to Ox. Played as CM after a long time, not his actual position and had Maitland-Niles besides him. Both did a great job.
— Sir Jenkinson (@theEpicGooner) January 28, 2017


The Ox has definitely enjoyed his central role so far...#SFCvAFC pic.twitter.com/macYDMhOcs
— Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) January 28, 2017


Bould has transformed Ox into a prime Pirlo in one game..Tears in my eyes
— Xhakahari (@Cechque) January 28, 2017


Ox-Coq midfield pairing whilst Xhaka is out looks a possibility.
— The Arsenal (@DareToWenger) January 28, 2017


I'd like to thank Perrie Edwards for this Ox performance this afternoon
— The Arsenist (@AngryGooner21) January 28, 2017


Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been absolutely brilliant today. Unplayable. So good to see him do well.
— #10 (@WengerTactic) January 28, 2017


3 of Oxlade-Chamberlain's best performances have come in the middle. Milan, Bayern & now Southampton. He could be some player in there. #afc
— Pablo (@AFCAMDEN) January 28, 2017


Oxlade-Chamberlain looked phenomenal in the middle today, great passing & drive, really put down a marker, hopefully he keeps it up #AFC
— Patrick Timmons (@PatrickTimmons1) January 28, 2017


Maitland-Niles and Oxlade Chamberlain are the new Vieira and Petit.
— Pablo (@AFCAMDEN) January 28, 2017

— Invincible (@UnrealMonrealFC) January 28, 2017


Oxlade-Chamberlain has made just eight Premier League starts this season, but his cup performance will give Wenger and Bould plenty to consider ahead of Tuesday's clash with Watford.
