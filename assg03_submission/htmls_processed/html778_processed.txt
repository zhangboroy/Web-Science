Manchester City and Arsenal are in advanced talks over the possible sale of Jack Wilshere.

The injury-prone midfielder, who believed to be integral to Arsene Wenger's plans, whipped up a social media storm last night when he started following Manchester City on Instagram.

One source at the Emirates has said that the club hierarchy are furious with Wilshere and his 'complete disregard for the club.'

'The deal hasn't been made official yet, so it's a bit disrespectful for Wilshere to be drawing so much attention to the deal.'
