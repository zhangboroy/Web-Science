SportArsene Wenger facing an Arsenal attacking conundrum after Gunners blitz of SouthamptonEngland duo Walcott and Welbeck put the Saints to the sword and now the Gunners French boss has decisions to make Share CommentsByDarren Lewis22:30, 29 JAN 2017Updated22:37, 29 JAN 2017SportVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowWatch this video againVideo will play in Arsene Wenger praises Arsenal after beating Southampton 5-0Share this videoWatch Next Share CommentsGet Arsenal FC updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email So who would be in your Arsenal front four now?   Theo Walcott may have hit the hat-trick but two-goal Danny Welbeck was the man who left Arsene Wenger buzzing on Saturday night.  The fit-again England striker also left his club boss with a conundrum.  Does Wenger now play Alexis Sanchez up front, with Mesut Ozil behind him and Welbeck and Walcott either side?  Does he go for Olivier Giroud up front with Sanchez behind him and Ozil on the left?  Or does he drop Walcott, leave Giroud up front and play a three in behind of Welbeck, Ozil and Sanchez?

Wenger fires back at ban critics: “Those who don’t like me, any sentence will be too lenient"

 Far from brooding over his four-match touchline ban from the FA on Saturday night, Wenger must have been playing his own private game of Fantasy Football in the stands at St Mary’s. He smiled afterwards: “It feels like I have many new strikers because Lucas Perez played very well and I left Olivier Giroud at home. “The problem will now be to find the right combination which will use them well in games. The result is strong with the balance of the team.

 “I [also] have Sanchez on the bench. It is an exceptional quality. For a long time we had not the offensive quality available. “I would say we have a larger squad than Chelsea but they don’t need too much because they don’t play in Europe. They are not in the Europa League or the Champions League.  “They will be in the Champions League next season but we have a larger squad.”

  Welbeck, making his first start since last May, was outstanding. Razor-sharp.  Under-strength Southampton simply had no answer to his pace, his ingenuity, his ruthless finishing and his determination to run the game.  He made two and set up another - all before half-time - to set Walcott on his way to his scintillating hat-trick. This is normally the stage of the season where Arsenal’s form falls off a cliff.  The point in the Premier League title race at which the Gunners are on their haunches, out of breath and unable to draw on their reserves until the serious contenders are beyond them.  This year the reserves are doing just fine. So much so that it is hard to see - draw permitting - the Wenger boys not making a serious bid for a third FA Cup trophy in four years come May.

 First things first, however, and Arsenal need to see off Watford on Tuesday before making some inroads on that eight-point cushion that Chelsea have built up. Last season they topped the table turning for home, only to win just two out of nine and tumble out of contention. This time around they have responded to damaging defeats at Everton and Manchester City by winning four out of five and making themselves Chelsea’s nearest challengers. They won’t be winning as easily as they did on September 24 when they face off again with the Blues next Saturday lunchtime.

 But Wenger pointed out that his Arsenal players are displaying a mental strength that many believed they didn’t have. “The test of our mentality is the amount of goals we have scored this season in the last five minutes and the number of people that have had an impact for us coming on. “The united feeling when you watch our team is for me a very important quality. “What is at stake now is to be consistent.”
