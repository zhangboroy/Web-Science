In previous campaigns, the difference had never been fewer than three points, with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger at the time confidently declaring somewhere between 82 and 86 points would be enough to win this season's title. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="145">The gap between first and fifth is now 12 points. At Chelsea's current points-per-game average of 2.5, they are on course to match the 95 that won them the title in 2004/05. It is a Premier League record haul no one expected to be challenged this term, certainly not by Chelsea. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="146">To open a conversation about Arsenal by talking about Chelsea may be confrontational in some parts of the capital, but it's more to give context to the fact the north Londoners are probably just about where they should be. There's no doubt they have endured patches of indifferent form but nothing out of the ordinary—even for a club with serious title aspirations. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="147">They have three more points than at the same stage last season, and they were top at the time. Throughout Arsenal's Champions League campaign, it has been difficult to make out the commentary above the teeth gnashing, but for all the criticism, they made it through to the knockout stages. And at the time of writing, they're still in the FA Cup, too. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="148">After 13 years without a title, though, the air in north London is rich with impotent incandescence, equal parts frustration and entitlement. No Premier League club lurches from a state of contentment to crisis and back again on pretty much a weekly basis like Arsenal.</p><div class="atom twitterEmbed" data-reactid="149"><!-- react-empty: 150 --><!-- react-empty: 151 --><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-reactid="152"><!-- react-text: 153 -->Bleacher Report UK<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 154 --> <!-- /react-text --><span class="acct" data-reactid="155"><!-- react-text: 156 -->@<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 157 -->br_uk<!-- /react-text --></span><p lang="en" dir="ltr" data-reactid="158">Arsene Wenger unleashes his finest Al Pacino inside the Arsenal dressing room. #AFC

His battle cry on the <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20170124/alexis">Arsenal website</a> this week will embolden the club's supporters and likely make Wenger feel a little lightheaded. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="166">"I feel really happy and comfortable at the club. I want to give the supporters a new title," said Sanchez. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="167">"We always get our fans' support through thick and thin, which is great.

Later in his report, he took John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/cesc-fabregas">Cesc Fabregas</a>, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/eden-hazard">Eden Hazard</a> and Diego Costa to task. It's easy to be brutal when putting pen to paper; Conte did it in person. Terry and Ivanovic have barely figured since, while Fabregas has only in patches fared much better. <br/><br/>Equally as impressive as having the personality to bomb out senior players without them disrupting the dressing room (Andre Villas-Boas, Rafa Benitez and even Jose Mourinho will vouch for the very real possibility of that happening) are the performances he has coaxed out of Hazard and Costa. He's portrayed as a manager who rules with a stick, but one suspects he's subtler than that. The best man-managers bring out the carrot just as readily. </p><div class="ad" data-reactid="225"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="226"><div id="br-ad-3509463" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="227"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="228">The remarkable transformative job Conte has done is never more evident than in the 30-point positive swing he has overseen in comparison to the same 22-match stage of last season. To put that figure into context, Leicester City were bottom of the Premier League at the same juncture in 2014/15. Claudio Ranieri en route to guiding them to the most remarkable title arguably in football history in 2015/16 had engineered a 27-point positive swing by the 22-match mark. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="229">That's not to suggest if Conte wins the league with Chelsea, it would in any way match Ranieri and Leicester's achievements, but it does bring to light the magnitude of the improvement he has engendered. With 16 matches left to play, Chelsea already have five more points than the 50 they finished with last season. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="230">If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Conte can afford to walk tall, given he has brought back into vogue playing three at the back.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="231">Prior to the Italian going all continental on us, the Premier League was borderline institutionalised in its affection for four-man defences. England's top flight is blessed with some of the finest tactical minds in the world, but each of Wenger, Guardiola, Mourinho, Jurgen Klopp and Maurico Pochettino are anglicised, to varying levels, in the trust they place in back fours. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="232">Conte has proved, like all the best coaches, he can find a solution beyond the chequebook. Victor Moses' metamorphosis from being a spare part at every club he has ever been at to one of the players of the season being a case in point. Why buy a world-class wing-back when you can mould one with hard work on the training field?</p><div class="ad" data-reactid="233"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="234"><div id="br-ad-4056092" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="235"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="236">His recent handling of Costa appears to have been equally exemplary. To say the matter is over before the January window has slammed shut is a little like presuming it's safe to return to a lit firework that hasn't gone off just because a reasonable period has elapsed. However, even if a shred of doubt lingers, Conte has nonetheless demonstrated to the rest of his squad that dissension will be met with discipline, even if the door is left ajar. It's that carrot and stick again. </p><div class="atom twitterEmbed" data-reactid="237"><!-- react-empty: 238 --><!-- react-empty: 239 --><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-reactid="240"><!-- react-text: 241 -->OptaJoe<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 242 --> <!-- /react-text --><span class="acct" data-reactid="243"><!-- react-text: 244 -->@<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 245 -->OptaJoe<!-- /react-text --></span><p lang="en" dir="ltr" data-reactid="246">100 - Diego Costa is playing his 100th game in all comps for Chelsea, scoring 51 goals and assisting 17 so far.

Here are his 10 best @premierleague hits...

Your favourite has been _____ https://t.co/utSrmY1PwG</p><a href="https://twitter.com/LFC/status/824184591774793729" data-reactid="314">1/25/2017, 9:18:13 AM</a></blockquote></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="315">"The only reason to have Sturridge in the team is for his finishing ability," Jamie Carragher said on <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/29327/10743229/daniel-sturridge-is-a-completely-different-player-now-to-when-he-first-came-to-liverpool">Sky Sports</a> after the out-of-sorts forward's profligacy proved costly on Wednesday night against Southampton. <br/><br/>"That's the case with that type of striker now, if they're not a target man, or don't run in behind, everything has got to be put on a plate. So when he doesn't score you're basically down to 10 men because they are not offering anything else whatsoever."</p><div class="ad" data-reactid="316"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="317"><div id="br-ad-126897721" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="318"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="319">When a former team-mate can be as caustic as that, it's a measure of how far Sturridge's stock has fallen. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="320">Amid the gloom, though, it's worth remembering five excellent months preceded a bad one. Liverpool have lost just two of their last 20 in the league and are only two points off second. Given they have finished in the top four just once since they should have won the Premier League in 2008/09—finishing eighth, sixth, second, seventh, eighth, sixth and seventh—it's hardly a catastrophe. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="321">If they can beat Chelsea on Tuesday to secure the double over Conte's side, all will be right with the world again on Merseyside. The Chelsea game kicks off a run that sees Liverpool play four of the top six in their next seven matches. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="322">No one expected Liverpool to win the league, so there shouldn't be too many tears when they don't. It takes a harsher critic than this one to suggest Klopp is not taking them in the right direction at pace. <br/><br/>That said, given Liverpool have won one trophy in the past decade, there's no getting around the fact losing to Southampton over two legs in a semi-final is a glorious opportunity squandered. <br/><br/>Sturridge will be kicking himself and, on current form, more than likely missing.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="323"> </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="324"><strong>Position and points after 22 matches last season:</strong> Eighth, 31 points (+14 point swing)</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="325"><strong>League form last six matches:</strong> WWWDDL</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="326"><strong>Next six matches:</strong> Chelsea (h), Hull City (a), Tottenham (h), Leicester City (a), Arsenal (h), Burnley (h)</p><div class="ad" data-reactid="327"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="328"><div id="br-ad-88222776" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="329"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="330"><strong>Final three matches: </strong>Southampton (h), West Ham United (a), Middlesbrough (h)</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="331"><strong>Matches left against top six (four in total):</strong> Chelsea (h) Jan 31, Tottenham (h) Feb 11, Arsenal (h) March 4, Manchester City (a) March 19<br/><br/><strong>Players currently in the physio room (six): </strong>Adam Lallana (knock), Nathaniel Clyne (rib injury), Marko Grujic (hamstring), Danny Ings (knee) </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="332"><strong>Player who most needs to stay out of the physio room: </strong>Philippe Coutinho</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="333"> </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="334">The adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder is trite and saccharine in equal measures, but there's no little truth to it. Mane is so direct in possession, it's borderline rude, and his hard running has been sorely missed. Liverpool have won 71.4 percent of games he has started, with that number dropping to 33.3 percent when he hasn't. He cannot return from international duty quick enough. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="335">Roberto Firmino, too, embodies everything that is good about Liverpool when on song, as industrious as he is technically brilliant, with his nine goals to date seeing him share top goalscoring honours with Mane.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="336">It is, however, difficult to look beyond Coutinho when earmarking Liverpool's most important player. Back from injury and having just signed a new contract amid reports Barcelona are making goo-goo eyes from afar, Klopp will implore his Brazilian playmaker to take his game to the next level over the next few seasons.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="337">He's one of few Premier League players, indeed across the world, who can genuinely take the breath away. </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="338">As Klopp noted after Coutinho signed his deal this week, he's the player everyone else wants. Contract or otherwise, the German is cute enough to know Liverpool must ensure they are Champions League regulars if they are keep him at Anfield long term.</p><div class="ad" data-reactid="339"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="340"><div id="br-ad-67285937" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="341"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="342"> </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="343"><em>All injury data taken from <a href="http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php">physioroom.com</a> and correct as of Jan 28.</em></p></div></div><footer data-reactid="344"><svg class="atom svg logo br-icon" data-reactid="345"><use xlink:href="/img/atoms/svg/logos.svg#br-icon" data-reactid="346"></use></svg><div class="atom share" data-reactid="347"><ul data-reactid="348"><li class="shareFacebook" title="Share this article on Facebook" data-reactid="349"><svg class="atom svg icon facebook" data-reactid="350"><use xlink:href="/img/atoms/svg/icons.svg#facebook" data-reactid="351"></use></svg></li><li class="shareTwitter" title="Share this article on Twitter" data-reactid="352"><svg class="atom svg icon twitter" data-reactid="353"><use xlink:href="/img/atoms/svg/icons.svg#twitter" data-reactid="354"></use></svg></li><li class="shareLink" title="Copy this link to your clipboard" data-reactid="355"><svg class="atom svg icon copy" data-reactid="356"><use xlink:href="/img/atoms/svg/icons.svg#copy" data-reactid="357"></use></svg></li></ul></div></footer><p class="feedback" data-reactid="358"><!-- react-text: 359 -->Like the new article format?
